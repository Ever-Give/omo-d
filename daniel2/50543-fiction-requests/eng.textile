I have two ideas that have might not have been done in this site. A story about a desperate female barista. And the second would be desperate female working at a cellphone store.

A lot of the time in cellphone stores, one person is finishing the shift and customers would take longer to deal with. It could make for good desperation.

As for desperate baristas, sometimes a person closes by themselves or they don't have time to run for the bathroom because it's busy. There is also all those liquids around.
