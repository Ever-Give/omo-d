Hey there! So, I’m planning to write some One Piece omo since the show doesn’t get much attention on this site and I’m taking requests for writing.

Here are the basic rules:

- I will only do basic omo involving desperation or wetting, no ab/dl or messing.

- Requested characters should be part of the canon storyline, no OC’s.

- You should give me a basic idea of what situation to put them in. EX: don’t just say “I want a fic with Zoro.” instead say “I want a fic where Zoro drinks too much booze and is stuck in a tight space with Sanji, determined not to let him know about his desperation.”

- This is optional, but I would prefer to know if you want the character to make it at the end or not.

Requests can take from just a week up to a whole month or two to write, depending on how busy I am at the time!

{{9 hours ago, Roronoa Zoro said:

Could you please do a story Of Nami. and Robin doing A peeHolding contest And and whoever loses the contest has to pee off the side of the ship. And I would like for Robin to be the one that has to pee off the ship.

I could do that, though I mainly wrote about male desperation a change could be fun!
