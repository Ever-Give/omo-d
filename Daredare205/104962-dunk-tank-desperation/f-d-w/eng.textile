Dunk Tank Desperation

Kira had just turned 18. She was known for her reputation as one of the popular girls in school because she had access to her parents' ridiculous mountain of money. She was 5’ 11”, slim, D-cup breasts hidden behind a black bikini bra with red outlines, toned stomach and very visible V where her tummy met her thighs. Her perfectly round butt was hidden behind a black bikini bottom with red strings. She had decided not to wear a visor or hat, allowing the sun to fill up her hypnotic blue eyes. Her brown hair was neatly combed and pulled into a ponytail that reached the bottom of her shoulder blades.

On this day, her given seat was the oh so familiar fall away seat of her parent's dunk tank at the local riverside festival. There was only one problem. It was quite hot in the afternoon sun, and nobody had managed to dunk her since 9:00 that morning when the air was still crisp and the water was cold. She knew the dunk tank challenge was difficult with the three separate targets that all need to be hit in only five attempts, but she didn't expect to be sitting there without being dunked a single time for more than four hours. She'd been trapped on that hard plastic seat for so long she felt like it was starting to fuse with her thighs. She thought about just leaving, but then she wouldn't get that $100 from her parents.

It was so hot and so boring, she just kept throwing $5 bills at her friends so they'd go buy her flavored teas and fancy sodas. Her grand drinking expedition had begun at 11am when she first got terribly bored, and it didn't seem like it would be stopping anytime soon. It was now 2:00 pm, two more hours until she could vacate the cold, hard plastic seat that trapped her above the nice, cold water waiting below. A chill ran down her spine as her bladder raised its voice to complain. Was she going to regret having all those drinks? She knew she needed to keep drinking to stay hydrated in the summer heat, but could her bladder hold out another two hours? All she wanted was for someone to win this stupid game and dunk her so she could relieve herself in the water below.

More coming when I feel like writing more lol

Kira looked at her watch. 2:15 pm. She swore it would've been 3:00 pm by now. But wait, here comes Jordan, the #1 pitcher in the local baseball team! Surely his incredible pitching skills would allow him to win the dunk tank game. He looked up at the girl in the tank, he knew her from somewhere… Where did he know her from? He scratched his head as he forced his mental gears to start turning again after a day of goofing off in the hot afternoon sun.

Jordan raised his hand and snapped his fingers. “Kira, from the softball team?”

“I'm surprised you remember me! We haven't talked in almost three years.” Responded Kira, her desperation being replaced with the excitement of catching up with old friends.

“I noticed you stopped coming to the baseball games when you started your senior year. Did you lose interest in the game?”

“Well, actually, I'd been going to the baseball games to watch how the boys play. I used that info to make myself more aggressive on the softball team… But then my parents told me that wasn't proper and I should just practice softball, so that's what I did. Gotta listen if I want that sweet green paper.”

“That's fair. Will you be coming to see the finals in the eastern city?”

“Yeah, I can come up with some excuse for why I want to see that game in particular.”

“I'll be waiting to see you there.”

“Sounds good, I can't wait! How about giving me a little demonstration now? All you gotta do is use those five balls to hit these three targets.”

“You know, five balls is way too many for just three targets.” Jordan handed his 75 cents to the kind lady beside the booth and asked her to only give him two balls. “How about we make this exciting?”

Jordan picked up the first ball and tossed it about a foot in the air. He did this several times before he turned around and walked away, putting an extra 5 feet between him and the targets.

Kira chuckled. “You're going to dunk me with only two balls, from that far away? If you can manage that, I'll do anything you want.” Kira knew, just as well as everyone else around, that what Jordan was about to attempt was impossible.

Jordan walked up to the tank and motioned for Kira to lean towards him. He whispered something to her, causing her face to flush before she began to protest. He reminded her that she'd promised him anything he wanted if he could pull it off. Kira seemed very uncomfortable before she remembered the truth of the situation. He couldn't pull this off if his life depended on it. The challenge was simply impossible.

Jordan smiled something nasty before once again retreating to his far away position. At this point, many nearby festival goers had stopped to watch the master pitcher try to hit three targets with only two balls, and from even further away than the recommended throwing position.

Jordan once again tossed the ball up in the air a few times before a serious look came over his face. His body moved like a professional, perfect coordination between his upper and lower body propelled the ball at big league speeds as it rocketed towards the center target. Bulls eye, smack in the middle! A resounding clang was heard throughout the area as the target moved back so fast it shook in place after clicking into its set position. Kira felt a click in the mechanism behind the chair she was seated on.

The kind lady handed Jordan his second ball. He once again tossed it in the air a few times before making his impressive pitch. The ball hit the target on the right, knocking it into its set position as the ball shot right at Kira’s face! She covered her face, only for the ball to hit the brace at the corner of the booth and fly right at the left target. It couldn't be. There was no way this was actually happening.

The collision between the ball and the left target was not hard, but it was enough to push the target into its set position. A pair of clicks came from the mechanism behind Kira and she suddenly became weightless before falling into the nice, cool water below. The sound of her splashing into the pool below her cut through the silence that had blanketed the area.

Jordan had done it. He’d set three targets with only two balls, and he'd done so from unreasonably far away. Kira couldn't believe it, and neither could many of the others around. She was glad for the noise of the cheering, as they masked her moans of desperation. There she was, in the water she'd longed to use for her afternoon pee break… But she'd made a promise, and now she had to honor that promise. She couldn't pee until after her shift ended. Her bladder loudly protested against this and became infuriated. She had to fight back just to avoid wetting herself right there and then.

After a moment to regain her composure, she climbed back up on the hard plastic seat and the sun began to dry the water from her skin. It wouldn't be long before she was roasting in the summer sun once more.

More coming when I feel like it 🙂

Thanks everyone for the feedback! I started writing this when I was home with COVID, and now I'm back at work and I'm still working extra to catch back up. Don't have writing time right now 😔

Believe me, I'm keeping notes any time in hit with inspiration. I've basically got ¾ of the next chapter figured out, I just gotta put it together in writing when I have time.
