Certainly, here's an adapted story:

### 🏢 The Conference and the Urgent Elevator Ride

Emilia, 18 years old and a trainee office clerk for the past six months, tried to slip away as inconspicuously as possible from the long, tedious marketing conference on the 7th floor. The last two hours had been pure torture. Every second the department head talked about sales forecasts, Emilia felt the **increasing pressure** – she **urgently** needed to go to the restroom. She had missed her chance during the break and now deeply regretted it.

Finally, the conference was over. Emilia gathered her papers with a speed that didn't match the usual leisurely pace of the office world. Her goal: the ladies' room on the ground floor.

Taking the stairs seemed too risky in her current state. So she rushed to the elevator. Luckily, it arrived almost immediately. She pressed the button for "E0" (ground floor) and took a quick breath.

The elevator started moving. Emilia nervously shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Unconsciously, she clenched her hand into a fist and pressed it lightly against her stomach to distract herself.

Then the bell rang, and the elevator stopped on the 5th floor. A middle-aged woman, elegantly dressed and carrying a large briefcase, got in.

"Good evening," said the woman kindly.

"Good evening," Emilia managed to stammer out.

The woman looked at Emilia and immediately noticed her tense posture. Emilia's legs began to **jiggle** slightly – a sign of inner tension that she couldn't control.

The elevator jolted briefly as it continued its descent, and at that moment Emilia flinched, a small pain shooting through her lower abdomen.

The elegant woman smiled understandingly. “A long meeting, I presume? You look like you’re in a terrible hurry.”

Emilia blushed. “Yes. I… I really need to get to the ground floor quickly.”

And then it happened. The elevator stopped with a **metallic clank**. Midway between the 4th and 5th floors. The lights flickered briefly and then came back on.

Emilia froze. The panic made the pressure suddenly much worse. She closed her eyes and gritted her teeth.

The other woman looked at the floor indicator, which was now blank. She pressed the emergency button, but nothing happened.

The woman turned to Emilia and said, in a gentle but firm voice, “Listen, the elevator is stuck. This could take a while. And I can see you’re in a hurry. In this situation, there’s only one thing that matters: **Stay calm and relax.** Focus on what you *can* do, not on what you can’t control.”

She opened her briefcase, took out a thick, unused presentation folder, and handed it to Emilia.

“We’re in an office building here. It’s not ideal, but we’re alone. Take this. I’ll turn around and face the door. **I won’t see or hear anything.** As soon as you’re finished, press the emergency button until someone answers.”

Emilia stared at the woman in disbelief. It was humiliating, but the woman's kind determination and the sudden prospect of relief outweighed everything else. She nodded hastily, took the folder, and turned to the back corner of the elevator.

The woman stood with her back to her. Emilia heard the soft sound of the briefcase lid closing, and the woman only said softly, “Everything will be alright.” It was the most embarrassing, but also the most urgent minute of Emilia's young professional life. And when it was over, it was the greatest relief she had ever felt.

She took a deep breath, relaxed her trembling legs, and then resolutely pressed the emergency call button. The woman smiled encouragingly at her as a voice finally crackled through the intercom.
