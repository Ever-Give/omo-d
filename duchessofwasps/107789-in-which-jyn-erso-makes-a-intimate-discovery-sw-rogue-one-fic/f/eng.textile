Hi folks! More desperate Jyn Erso for y'all, this time with a side of kink discovery!

EDIT If you opened this when I first posted it when the formatting was really screwy I'm so sorry, I didn't know HTML didn't work here oops 🫣

###

Jyn rushed down the hall to the door of their quarters, squirming as she tried to put in the passcode. She was so distracted by her full, heavy bladder that she got it wrong the first and second time, and Cassian had to tap it in when he caught up with her so she could hobble inside. The proximity of their bathroom, the knowledge that relief was so close, sent another wave of utter desperation though her, and Jyn had to stop in the middle of the room, doubled over and holding herself with both hands to keep from losing it while she was so close. She could hear Cassian chuckling as the door slid shut behind him.

“This isn’t funny,” she grumbled, straightening back up carefully, already unbuckling her belt in preparation as she took another few waddling steps toward the small ‘fresher.

Finally, finally she could pee. The briefing she and Cassian had been sitting in all afternoon had just ended, but Jyn didn’t remember more than a few sentences of the whole thing. After chugging a couple bottles of water after her workout and two cups of coffee to try to stay awake, she’d had no time for a pee break before the classified and vitally, closed-access briefing she’d had to attend. Her bladder had been full by the end of the first hour, but security measures prevented anyone from leaving or returning while the meeting was in session, so, she’d held it in. It was hardly the first time, but by three hours in she’d decided it was the worst, trying not to squirm in her seat, her bladder begging to be relieved. It was round and firm, swollen with pee. She’d even tried to show Cassian, guiding his hand to it as he sat beside her, though he’d been more focused on the meeting and not given her the sympathy she’d hoped for.

All that to say she was truly, utterly desperate, now, so needy she was almost annoyed with herself. She could hardly wait to seat herself on the toilet and unleash the ocean she had been holding back. Just a few more steps…

And then suddenly there was Cassian, blocking her from the ‘fresher door.

“It’s a little funny,” he teased, but there was something dark and intense in his gaze that didn’t match his words. Not that Jyn had the time or extra energy to care about that, or anything else other than her brimming bladder.

“Move, I have to pee!” she whined, but Cassian shook his head.

“I know you do. But I want to try something, do you trust me?”

“I swear, Andor, if you don’t get out of my way I’m going to piss right here!”

“If you really need to, go right ahead,” he said, smirking, then pulled her closer by the waist. “But again, do you trust me?”

She was almost tempted to say no. Her bladder was begging to be emptied, and he was preventing her from doing so, but trust was something they didn’t joke about, it was sacred, and so instead she groaned and reluctantly muttered “...Yes.”

“You remember your safeword,” he murmured, and Jyn nodded instinctively because she did, obviously, but why the fuck would it matter right now?

Then suddenly Cassian was picking her up, pulling her legs around his waist and pinning her to the door of their quarters, his eyes dark and fixed intently on her.

“Cassian!” Jyn gasped, whimpering as the movement jostled her bladder. It took all her strength not to leak. “I’m serious, I’m about to burst!”

His lips quirked up in a smile. “But you’re so cute like this. All needy and squirmy…” He kissed her then, just a quick press of his lips to hers. “It’s kinda sexy.”

“You’re playing a dangerous game, Andor. Now is not the time to be flirting.” She didn’t stop him from kissing her again, however, and she let him deepen it, kissing him back in spite of herself because force, Cassian could kiss. For one wild second she wanted nothing more than to follow his unexpected lust to its natural conclusion, to throw caution to the wind and let him fuck her right then and there, but her bladder shut that thought down as quickly as it appeared with another wave of need. She groaned into the kiss, whimpering as she forced herself to pull away from him.

“I’m not kidding,” she whined, “You have to put me down, I'm about to lose it! Do you want to get peed on?”

Cassian laughed, but there was something a little bit off about it. He didn’t quite meet her eyes. It almost seemed like - but no, that didn’t - he wouldn’t -

“...Cassian Jeron Andor!” She gasped, and stared at him, shocked. Cassian blushed deeply, his eyes darting down, but said nothing. It only confirmed her suspicion. “You do, don’t you! You actually want me to piss on you!”

“Well… I wouldn’t be that upset if you did,” he said, still blushing. He was clearly trying to play it cool, but Jyn could see right through it. She had spent more than enough time under Cassian Andor to recognize when something was turning him on.

“You want me to pee on you,” Jyn repeated, incredulous. She knew, of course, that some people liked that sort of thing, but Cassian, her Cassian? Her reserved, respectable Cassian?

“It’s not that weird, is it?” He ventured, still not meeting her gaze. “Just… a little bit kinky?”

“A lot bit kinky,” Jyn corrected, then squirmed with another surge of intense desperation, screwing her eyes shut and panting with the effort of holding back. “Look, I really need to go, and I don’t really want to wet my pants, so can we -” She cut herself off with a low groan. “Can we maybe talk about this later?”

“How about you wet my pants?” Cassian asked, and he was trying to be sexy, she could tell, but the question was just so absurd. He couldn’t actually want that, could he? “You’re full to bursting. Let me help you.”

“I don’t - ngh - I dunno, Cass,” she said as he finally put her down, back on her feet. Her legs felt like jelly. She was just so full… Her bladder ached, and she knew if she didn’t pee soon she was going to start losing control. “Sweet force, I can’t hold it much longer…”

“Gods, Jyn…” Cassian looked even more excited if that was possible, but the lust dilating his brown eyes was beginning to be tempered by a cautious hesitation, like he was remembering himself. “I mean - no, I know it’s weird. You can just go and pee if you aren’t interested, I’ll give you privacy, I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”

She really should. She should have definitely been on the toilet and peeing right that moment. She certainly shouldn’t have been entertaining the idea. But then…

“What would it entail?”

“What?”

“If I said yes. What specifically would you want to happen?”

“It’s fine.” He was blushing again, and not quite looking at her. “You’re not into it, I don’t want to push you into anything. You can just forget I said anything.”

Jyn appreciated the sentiment, not that she was surprised. He was always so careful of her boundaries, always made her feel respected. Jyn cursed herself for her initial reaction to his request - yes, it was a shock to hear from Cassian, and no, it wasn’t a kink she’d ever had any particular interest in, but that didn’t mean it had to be an automatic no. Cassian was always so damned selfless. He almost never asked for anything he wanted, especially not sexually, and she’d gone and acted all scandalized the one time he did.

“I’m not going to do anything I don’t want to. Tell me what you want me to do. You’ve obviously thought about it. Tell me what happens in those fantasies.”

“I…” He looked a little overwhelmed. Some of the shame was melting out of his expression, thankfully, but it was far from all of it. She would have liked to give him time to put his words together as carefully as he liked to but even as he trailed off she found herself having to press her thighs even tighter together, shifting her weight restlessly as her heavy bladder throbbed with need.

“I’m kinda on borrowed time right now, Cass. Tell me quick or I’m going to burst before anything can happen.”

It was a little amusing, the way his interest visibly flared at the reminder of just how badly she needed to go. It was abundantly clear that he was really into this, and it only convinced her further that she was right to consider indulging him.

“I mean, you said it before. I want you to… you know…”

“If you can’t even say it out loud, I’m definitely not going to do it. I need details, do you want me to like… piss in your hair or something? ‘Cuz that might be too much for me.”

“No, no, not like that. Just…”

She wanted to give him time to gather his thoughts. Really, she did. It was sort of fun to watch him squirm, so obviously aroused despite his embarrassment. But Jyn was squirming too, she was fucking bursting and she really didn’t have any time to give him.

“Tell me.”

“I want… I want you to sit in my lap, and then just… relax.” He licked his lips and looked up, finally making eye contact with her, regaining some of his boldness from before. “I want you to pee in my lap.”

“Hm…” Jyn tilted her head, shifting her weight restlessly from one leg to the other as she thought about it. “Sounds messy.” It wasn’t a no, and she could tell by the growing excitement clear on his face that Cassian knew it.

“We could do it in the shower,” he ventured, “Easy clean-up, and I’ll take care of it. You won’t have to do anything.”

“Except piss on you, you mean,” Jyn said, a smirk finding its way onto her face.

“Well. Yes.”

Jyn took a moment to think about it. She tried to imagine it. Sitting in Cassian’s lap was nice, she already liked that part. As for peeing like that, she wasn’t quite sure (though her bladder was screaming so loud to be emptied that the idea of peeing anywhere was appealing to a certain degree). The deciding element, really, was that it was Cassian. Maybe she wouldn’t get off on peeing on him, but she did get off on getting him off. If it made Cassian this excited just to think about, wasn’t that reason enough?

What the hell. She’d done weirder things for people she’d loved a lot less.

“Ok.”

“...Ok?” Cassian looked as if he didn’t quite dare to hope, but Jyn didn’t have time for a song and dance about this.

“I’ll piss on you. But this is happening right now. I’m about to explode.”

“I - yeah, of course,” Cassian said, shaking himself into action, flicking the light on in the ‘fresher and opening the shower door. At least he seemed to understand the urgency of the situation. Jyn hurried to get out of her shirt and jacket, squirming as she let her pants fall to the floor, then had to stop for a moment to hold herself, dancing in place to keep the pee inside just a little longer. When the worst of the wave of desperation passed she reached for the waistband of her boxers, but Cassian stopped her with a hesitant hand.

“Leave those on?”

“Perv,” she teased, deciding she wasn’t going to question it. “Gonna take off your pants?” He'd taken off his holster and belt already, and unbuttoned to make room for his growing erection, but made no move to push them down (and force, the way those pants fit him, it should have been illegal... but that was beside the point).

“Um, no, I... it's hot.”

“It's fucking kinky, is what it is.”

“I thought we’d already established that?“

She liked the way he was blushing, not at all like the Alliance's best agent, biting his lip and endearingly shy for a man practically begging her to use his lap as a toilet. Fuck, she loved him.

Cassian climbed into the shower and she followed, a little clumsier than she usually managed (but really fucking graceful for someone with a bladder so full she looked a little pregnant, thank you very much). He patted his lap shyly, offering her a seat, and she took it. His arms were warm and secure around her waist. Under different circumstances this might have been relaxing, but in her desperation the proximity of his body just made her even more aware of the fact that she was sitting on his lap and, apparently, about to piss all over him.

She could feel him rock hard against her, felt his cock twitching as she shifted, trying to settle. It was one of her favorite parts of sitting in his lap to play usually, but now the feeling was a little overshadowed by her bladder’s plea. Jyn had always prided herself on being good at waiting, but she was about done. She could feel a small leak escaping her, dampening her boxers, and she quickly pressed her thighs tighter together and held herself with one hand, squirming in his lap as she fought the urge out of instinct.

“Fuck…” She growled, shifting her hips restlessly.

“Don’t fight it,” Cassian murmured. His voice in her ear, low and intimate, made her shudder. “You can let go now.”

Jyn felt a jolt of excitement despite herself. Bastard, using his bedroom voice when she was squirming and leaking in his lap. It was just that voice, she reminded herself. That voice, and his warm body pressed close, and his erection under her, of course she was a little excited. No other reason.

She felt his hand on her lower abdomen, probing gently. He didn't press very hard but it was still enough to make her go stock-still, moaning softly.

"Fuck," she whined again.

"You're so full," Cassian purred, voice low and rough and so obviously aroused, caressing her bladder bulge. "Stars, just look at you, you're bursting. I've never seen a bladder this full.”

"Well, I guess it’s good someone’s enjoying it," Jyn muttered.

"You have no idea how fucking sexy it is," Cassian groaned, pressing his mouth to her neck. She was torn between the desire to arch into his touch and the desperate need to stay completely still, screwing her eyes shut as he massaged her bladder.

“So now it’s sexy,” She blew out a breath as another wave of need hit her. “How come you were so weird about it when I tried to show you how full I was in the meeting.?”

"That was… it was different.” She opened her eyes just in time to see a pretty blush spread over his face again, and Jyn couldn’t help but be charmed. He was just so handsome she was almost mad about it. “You were just making a joke, you didn’t know it was a sex thing for me. It would have been taking advantage.”

She managed not to laugh - she’d burst for sure if she did - but it was a near thing.

“Oh my stars, Cass, you were trying to be a gentleman?”

“Shut up.” His ears were a little red, her wonderful, ridiculous man.

“Don’t worry, you’re absolutely the most gentlemanly man who’s ever asked me to piss on him.”

He rolled his eyes fondly. “Just pee already. You’re dying for it.”

"I am. Force, Cassian, I've never had to go this badly."

“Fuck, yeah, I can see how much you need it..." He rubbed her bladder again, his touch a little firmer, and Jyn couldn’t help but groan at the pressure. "Just let go, Jyn."

"I -" she swallowed hard, feeling another trickle escape her, further wetting her underwear. Cassian noticed it too, judging by the way he practically purred, pressing his erection harder into her ass.

"You're leaking, look at that. You don’t have to hold it anymore. Just let go, I want to feel it."

"Dirty boy," Jyn teased weakly, but she could admit that she was liking the effect this was having on him. Cassian was the most selfless lover she'd ever had. He always put her needs first. The sight of him like this, so worked up he was panting in her ear and begging for her to wet herself on him, was more than a little sexy in spite of how unexpected it was.

"Only for you," he agreed, kissing her neck, nipping at her pulse point. "Let go, love. Do you need me to talk you through it?"

Jyn bit her lip, squirming a little. Maybe she did - it turned out pissing her pants in her boyfriend’s lap was a little easier said than done, even with a bladder that felt like a reservoir ready to overflow. She was honestly having a hard time getting started.

“Yeah, that… that might help.This just feels kinda weird.”

Cassian nodded, his eyes dark with desire. His hands were still stroking her lower abdomen, rubbing slow circles on her bulging bladder, and that was helping already.

“I know. But there’s no one here to judge you. It’s just me, I’ve got you.”

Jyn had half a mind to make a snarky reply, but instead all that came out was a moan as he rubbed her aching bladder a little harder. There was a feeling almost like her bladder was unlocking itself, and she panted into Cassian’s neck, her hips shifting unconsciously against him, making him groan.

“I want you to, I promise. I really, really want you to. You’re so full, you’ve been holding it for so long. Just piss for me.”

She could hear his breath quicken, his voice low and rough, and it was just so absurd, but some part of her, deep down, couldn’t help but find it hot. Just a little. There was no she was getting into this, was there? This was just for Cassian. She’d never even considered wanting anything like this in her life.

(But then again, she hadn't ever thought her respectable, stoic spy of a boyfriend would have a piss kink, either. And yet, here they were).

“It’s coming,” she whined.

“That’s right. Let it out. That poor bladder is so full and heavy, just let it empty. Relax and let it all go.”

A spurt of urine shot into her underwear, and she gasped, whimpered. Cassian’s breath caught with excitement, his eyes dark with lust.

“That’s it. You're so close, Jyn, you’re gonna pee for me. So full and needy, look how bad you want it. It’ll feel so good.”

It was ridiculous. It was ridiculous and bizarre and utterly unlike her. But somehow, his filthy, absurd praise was what did it.

The dam broke, the floodgates opened, and suddenly she was pissing uncontrollably.

Her underwear was heavy and saturated in just seconds, the sudden gush soaking them and then running down her thighs and into Cassian’s lap. It felt like a river, a geyser. The release was so good she could hardly think, her head tipped back as she whimpered with sheer relief.

It didn't stop. She peed, and peed, and Cassian was right, it did feel good. It was warm, and relieving, and, stars, so fucking intimate. It should have been embarrassing. It should have been weird. She was entirely vulnerable, the situation entirely new. But she found she wasn't worried - because this was Cassian. There was a reason he was the only person in the galaxy she would have done anything like this for.

"That's it," he crooned in her ear, his voice low and soothing. "Gods, look at you. Flooding my lap. It feels so good.”

It was weird. It was so fucking weird, and it should not have been even the tiniest bit sexy. She was peeing on her boyfriend. On purpose.

And yet…

“Fuck,” she moaned. It did feel good. It felt so good. And part of that was the relief, of course, the way it felt to finally release a heavy bladder but sweet fucking force, this wasn’t just the relief of peeing. This was more. It felt good. Somehow, despite everything, it was turning her on.

And of course, Cassian could tell. Because her sweet, wonderful, filthy spy of a boyfriend never missed anything, not even when he was being used as a toilet at his own request, not even when he was groaning softly in delight. Even with her face tucked in the crook of his neck, somehow he could tell.

"You like this," he murmured, his voice breathless with pleasure and full of wonder. "Force, Jyn, you really like this?”

“I…” She shouldn’t have any shame left, but her face heated again anyway. Her pee kept flowing, the relief so good it made her moan again, helpless.

“You’re already pissing on me, Jyn. You’re - fuck, you’re soaking me.” He was rocking her hips under her, making her stream splash in his lap. “I’m not about to think any less of you if you tell me it feels good. I love this, do you?”

“I…”

Oh, what the hell.

“Yes,” she finally whimpered into his neck. “I like it. It feels - oh… feels so good to pee… empty this bladder…”

“I know, baby. It’s so much. Fuck, this is perfect.”

It was like nothing else. Peeing after hours of holding, flooding her lover’s lap, safe in his arms. It was almost orgasmic. The agonizing tension flowed out of her, all the pressure dissipating as her heavy bladder lightened, as the warm liquid pooled around them. Somehow she was still peeing, it was still coming out, and it was just what her poor, bursting bladder had been begging for. It was blissful. And she could no longer help but admit to herself that somehow, it was deeply, intimately erotic.

Cassian was still murmuring in her ear as she released, groaning, coaxing her to keep peeing for me, that’s it, baby, soak me, you’re doing so good. He was thrusting up against her still, cock hard as steel, his breathing rough and unsteady, and she knew him well enough to know - he was going to cum. From this.

She was driving Cassian Andor, the most self-disciplined man she’d ever known, to the point of losing control. By pissing on him.

“Gonna cum?” She breathed, hardly daring to believe it.

“Yes,” he gasped, “Fuck, yes. So good.”

For a moment she worried she wouldn’t be able to keep up the stream long enough to get him off - as insanely full as her bladder had been, it was draining steadily and she could feel it getting closer to empty.

But her worries were for nothing. Cassian gave a strangled groan, and that was all the warning she got before his hips jerked up under her and he came just as beautifully as always.

She lifted her head, finally, to watch his orgasm, the way his jaw went slack and his eyes squeezed shut, the blissful expression he wore. Her Cassian, her favorite person in the galaxy. She’d watched him fall apart under her countless times - but never quite like this.

As if on cue, her stream finally began to slow, her exhausted bladder giving up the very last of its contents. Her pee trickled out for a few more moments, and then finally stopped, leaving her soaked and empty as Cassian looked up at her like she’d hung the stars in the night sky.

“Jyn,” he sighed, looking and sounding absolutely ruined, his arms tight around her waist.

She wanted to tease him, tell him he looked pretty fucked-out for a man who hadn't gotten fucked at all, but he looked so blissed-out and happy she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

Instead, she leaned down and kissed him. It was slow, lazy. A little messy, but no more than the rest of the situation. Cassian held her surprisingly gently, stroking her back and running his fingers through her hair, his lips soft against hers.

"You're welcome," she teased, but he couldn’t have missed the satisfaction in her tone.

“Yes, thank you,” He breathed, his voice still delightfully unsteady. “That was… fuck.”

"Yeah," Jyn agreed, unable to keep a grin off her face. “It was.”

She kissed him again, humming happily into it, and then sat back, trying for casual and missing by a mile. "You're a kinky bastard, Andor.”

“Shut up, like you didn’t enjoy it. It won you over in the end.”

“I really needed to go.”

“We both know that wasn’t all it was.”

“Asshole,” She said affectionately, though she knew he could read her too well to be fooled. He knew he was right, whether she’d admit it or not.

(And maybe she would, eventually. But first she’d have to figure out what exactly it was she’d be admitting).

“I know, I’m the worst.” He grinned.

“You really are.” She stood up from his lap, finally, her boxers soaked and heavy, once again wanting to giggle at the absurdity, and reached for the shower faucet. She was certainly glad they’d done this in the tub. “C’mon, let’s get cleaned up.”

“Yes, ma’am,” Cassian teased, dragging himself upright beside her, still grinning like a satisfied tooka-cat in his drenched pants. Jyn couldn’t help the wave of helpless affection at the ridiculous sight, because fuck it all, she loved every inch of this man, and now he’d gone and given her a piss kink. Maybe. Cassian. Her Cassian.

“Then after I’ll take you to bed and show you just how much I liked that, yeah?”

Jyn didn’t even try to suppress the fluttering of excitement that idea triggered in her core. “I want your mouth on me.”

“Oh, baby. Anything.”

I am the kind of writing dragon that feeds on feedback and comments and writing kink fic is not great for that unfortunately, so if you got this far I would be so happy to hear what you thought of it!

I really enjoyed this story! I loved how it went from them joking around, to him confessing he'd like it to her realizing how much he likes it. It was a nice, realistic progression, and the healthy communication made it so much better!

And then the rest of it, so hot 🔥

Thank you so much 💚 realistic and hot was absolutely the goal and I'm so happy it worked!

I really enjoyed this. Male vulnerability is a terribly rare thing to find in kink fiction. And you write a real relationship, rather than a pedestalled romantic version of one.

Have you considered doing other pairings?

}}

Thank you so much! I always try to write characters and dynamics that feel like they exist outside of just the sexy things I write them doing and I'm so pleased that came through. As for other pairings, it really just all comes down to what the muses get up to in the future 😅 I'm certainly not opposed, I actually have written bits and pieces of stories with other characters (mostly Star Wars as well but unfortunately all unfinished) but Jyn and Cass are my favourites and they just seem to come easier lol

New here so apologies for the late response, but holy moly......... this was so good! I always love to see when a character's desperation/desire trumps their embarrassment and hesitation, absolutely delicious trope. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by how exceedingly wholesome this was! I adore the way you've portrayed their love - in the way that Jyn sees her Cassian, in the way that they know each other intrinsically, in the way that they nurture each other. So, so sweet and such a pleasure to read.

I also felt a bit of a kinship with Cassian in that I, too, was quite bashful in confessing my kink to my partner. He reacted in a similar way to Jyn, all laughs and playful teasing, but was open to it from the start because, like Jyn, knowing how much I enjoyed it was enough for him to enjoy it, too. Maybe that's why I love the tenderness between these two characters so much :'))

In any case, excellent work and thank you for the food! You've got a knack for this writing thing ❤️

Thank you so much, this is such a lovely compliment! I'm glad you enjoyed 💚
