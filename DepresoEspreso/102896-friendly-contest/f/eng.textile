Friendly contest

It was a relatively relaxed day, with everyone in their usual places. Luffy eating. Sanji and Zoro arguing with each other. Usopp and Franky building whatever odd things they could think of. Chopper mixing various medicinal plants. Robin reading. Brook playing music and Jinbe quietly watching it all.

Nami was a bit bored with the relative normalcy. She wanted some action, some excitement. She had recently found something out about herself, when she had woken up with a full bladder one morning. She actually enjoyed that feeling of discomfort, the feeling of testing her limits and the potential for her to lose control at any moment. She wanted to share that feeling with someone, as a contest of sorts.

She had already considered her options.

Luffy? Too weak willed, he would piss himself instantly to avoid the discomfort.

Zoro? He would be too proud to ever do something like that.

Usopp? He would be too annoying to deal with in that situation for it to be worth it.

Sanji? Absolutely not. No way did she want that stupid pervert to make some disgusting comment on her bladder.

Chopper? Too innocent.

Franky? No. Just no.

Brook? He doesn’t even have a bladder! (At least, Nami was pretty sure he didn’t…she sure as hell wasn’t going to ask him.)

Jinbe? He didn’t seem like he would be okay with doing that.

But Robin? She would be alright with it. She wouldn’t turn down a chance to get closer to any of the Strawhats, even if it meant doing something like this, along with the fact that she also seemed relatively bored with the lack of recent excitement. It was decided, Nami was going to do a holding contest with Robin, and add a few twists to spice things up.

––––––––––––––––

Robin was relaxing in her room, reading a book quietly when she heard a knock and a familiar voice from outside. “Heyyyy Robin! I’m respecting your privacy by knocking, but asserting my authority as your crewmate by coming in anyway!” Followed by Nami slamming the door open enthusiastically. Robin looked up at her and smiled, as she almost always cheered up when Nami was around. “So, Robin. I have a…challenge, of sorts…that I want you to participate in!” Robin was intrigued.

“What exactly does this challenge of yours entail? I’m alright with just about anything.” Nami gave a grin, before looking down awkwardly. “So this might sound weird but…would you be interested in a holding contest?” Robin chuckled lightly, not expecting that answer. “If it makes you happy I’ll do it. It does sound interesting, but since it’s you that I’m dealing with, I’m guessing there’s more to it?” Nami just nodded. “I’ll explain the details later, but right now I’ve ordered some drinks from-” The door burst open as Sanji waltzed in with hearts in his eyes.

“Nami-Swan!~ Robin-Chwan!~ I have your drinks!~” Sanji set them on the table, being careful not to spill a single drop. “I Made them with extra care, I hope you enjoy them!~” Nami rolled her eyes and Robin just sighed in amusement before thanking him for the drinks. “Anytime, m’lady!~” Sanji stepped out of the room before gently closing the door. Two very large drinks sat on the table. An orange fizzy one with a foam coating on the top, which Robin assumed was Nami’s, and a turquoise one, with not as much fizz but a decorative leaf on the top. Nami grabbed her drink and took a large sip.

“Mmmm! Tangerine flavor! Sanji really knows what he’s doing!” Robin took a sip of her own, and was greeted with a refreshing, minty flavor that was both soothing and incredibly tasty. “Well, I suppose we should finish these and get to the fun part as soon as we can?” Robin asked, and Nami nodded, before taking a large swig of her drink.

––––––––––––––––

By the time both drinks were finished, Nami felt incredibly full, and was already starting to feel a barely noticeable twinge in her bladder, before she realized she hadn’t told Robin about the special twists. “So, Robin…I may have tweaked the rules a little. Normally a holding contest is just ‘Whoever pees themself first loses’ and I wanted to change that! So, first off, no forfeits are allowed. This means no going to the bathroom until the other person loses. Second, losing doesn’t mean you have to wet yourself, you can go off the side of the ship if it gets really bad. Third, and probably the most important, don’t tell anyone about this. The last thing we need is those stupid pervs Sanji, Franky and Brook breathing down our necks about our bladders…”

Robin nodded and picked her book back up, understanding exactly why Nami didn’t want word to get around the ship.

Roughly 30 minutes later

Nami was really starting to feel something from her bladder, and the occasional twinges were slowly growing more frequent. She shifted in her seat and found a somewhat comfortable position to ease her discomfort. She glanced over to Robin, who appeared to be in the same boat, pressing her thighs together while still reading her book. This first sign of Robin’s discomfort made Nami unreasonably excited, and she wished she knew what was going through Robin’s head at that moment.

––––––––––––––––

Robin flipped through page after page of her book, not really paying close attention to any of the words in front of her. A more urgent matter kept nagging at the back of her mind, more specifically, the large drink from earlier had finally reached her bladder. Or at least, some of it did. She wasn’t sure what was worse, the nagging discomfort that she couldn’t seem to push into the back of her mind, or the knowledge that it was going to get worse.

10 minutes later

Robin was definitely feeling it now. It hadn’t even been an hour and she felt damn near close to bursting. She shifted in her seat, sprouting a new pair of arms to grab herself as she flipped through her book, not even bothering to look at the pages anymore. She looked over to Nami, who seemed to be a bit more comfortable than her, with one leg crossed over the other but no other signs of discomfort.

––––––––––––––––

Nami hoped her discomfort wasn’t too evident as she crossed her legs, glancing over to Robin who looked much more desperate, using her Devil Fruit powers to hold herself. Nami giggled softly at the sight, but stopped as she was assaulted by another throb from her bladder. She grabbed herself with one hand, the other one shaking slightly. Nami suddenly felt an intense wave, as she leaked slightly. That’s okay…you’re okay…

She was beginning to wonder if she would lose, but suddenly, Robin's usually calm voice that was now laced with desperation piped up. “C-can I…go off the ship now…?” Nami looked back to see a small dark patch on Robin’s dress. Nami gave a thumbs up and smirked, before quickly putting her hand back on her crotch “Alright…but this means I win…”

––––––––––––––––

Robin approached the edge of one of the more secluded parts of the ship and slowly removed her dress, her hands shaking. She sat over the edge and…the relief was amazing. A loud hiss filled the air, but the crew was too busy doing other things to notice, much to Robin’s delight. Her release lasted for a whole 2 minutes, as she sighed loudly. After she finished, she went back to her room to change and relax.

––––––––––––––––

Nami had just barely made it. She flung the door to the bathroom wide open and slammed it with just as much force as before. She pulled down her pants and as she was sitting down, she started releasing as she moaned softly in relief. A few minutes later she stood back up and slipped everything back on, sighing at the feeling of being empty once again.

A/N: Yay, it’s finally here! Sorry it took so long, I had to take a quick break to help out my friend who literally tried to unalive, so uh…sorry about that guys! Also I’ve scrapped my fic idea and will start chapter 2 of the Lucci fic tomorrow if everything goes smoothly!

Well, she’s alright now, thank god. But yeah! Do tell! I need ideas, and if given free rein, I’ll write nothing but Water 7 related fics and there’s like only one person on this site who would actually read them all…

These…aren’t characters from the Water 7 arc, my dude. I can understand the confusion though.

{{5 hours ago, Roronoa Zoro said:

So since my characters are not from water 7.Are you not gonna write A fic about them

}}

That’s not what I’m-

I’m willing to write those fics, I just have some other stuff I need to work on.

Also that guy seemed to think that those were also characters from the Water 7 arc since I brought it up…it made sense in context.
