Being a Robot Means Never Having to Go to the Bathroom

"I remember that Futurama scene - Fry couldn't walk like a robot, and when Leela asked why he admitted that he had to go to the bathroom - so Leela took him to an alley to pee against a wall

What struck me about that scene was, if they'd been on the planet long enough for Fry to have to pee... didn't Leela have to pee too?

Was Leela standing there with a full bladder, having to watch Fry relieve himself while she had to keep holding it, because all Fry had to do was unzip his fly and whip it out, while Leela would have had to pull down her pants and squat - making it really obvious that she was not a robot!

If I'd written that scene, I'd have Leela as desperate to pee as Fry was, but unable to do anything about her need to urinate and having to watch Fry while he got relief that she needed as badly as he did"

Yes that's a good point, I probably would have addressed the fact that she needs to go to the bathroom as well. I do think that most peeing scenes do involve men though. And it kind of makes sense that Fry would be the one who was peeing because he could do it discreetly and they made it think that he was leaking coolant, where as with Leela it would probably be a lot more obvious what she was doing although it definitely would have been more interesting!

But yes they didn't address the fact that she would probably have to go to the bathroom as well, although maybe they could attribute after the fact that she was a mutant so maybe she has better bladder capabilities than an ordinary human would. Actually that would be a pretty good story as well, woman with a mutant power to hold an incredibly full bladder effortlessly who becomes the envy of all her friends!

Once again when you go into the realm of science fiction, even in fetish stuff, you don't have to worry about limitations on the imagination, which is probably why most of what I write is science fiction and that even carries over into my omorashi stuff often. Which once again is sometimes a shame when you have to separate your fetish stuff from your more "serious" stuff under your own name. I do feel this is one of those stories that a person without a pee fetish could probably read in a mainstream collection of robot stories without necessarily thinking that it had a fetish intention in mind.

I did have another story idea basically about a robot android that was built to replicate a flesh and blood woman as a way of trying to understand bladder troubles, and the robot being self-aware has to deal with the problem of what it feels like to have a full bladder, which is something no robot had had to deal with previously. It's almost like the reverse of this story I guess, where you have a robot character having to deal with going to the bathroom instead of a human character having to deal with going to a bathroom in a robot society. And I had another one I wanted to do about the troubles of using an alien toilet.

That was an excellent sighting you had, but you are totally right stuff like that happens often and it's especially cruel almost for a guy to ask his girlfriend or female companion to stand guard for him while he urinates multiple times while she doesn't even get to go once. Once again it shows how patient women are even in the face of extreme unfairness and blatant torture! It is amazing how even when a woman is dying to go to the bathroom she will stop multiple times and stand cover so that her male companion can relieve themselves multiple times like that, truly maddening!

"The scanner thing is so amazing... imagine knowing how full people around us are"

In lots of sci-fi movies with robots in the future the robots can often see an infrared and scan a person and know all this stuff about them, so I don't think it's much of a stretch to think that robots could determine how badly somebody had to pee by scanning their bladder or using voice analysis as a way of knowing that they were distressed.

If you like that as a concept you would probably like my novel An Aura of Desperation, in which certain men gain the ability to psychically know how badly a woman has to go to the bathroom by reading their auras.

"Yeah, it's amazing how many women will stand there with a bursting bladder, keeping watch while their male companion gets to relieve himself right in front of her"

I've never actually been a lookout standing watch for somebody while they relieve themselves but I have definitely been around people who have relieved themselves in a very obvious manner and not said anything. And the truth is although it would annoy me if somebody said stand guard while I watch and go relieve myself I probably would do it but it would still be driving me crazy! I think maybe a lot of women really are masochists or just too accommodating of male urinary privilege!

Yes I think that people with a fetish it's kind of hard not to react strongly to a story about people going to the bathroom. People around me know that I find anything related to bathrooms interesting so I could easily show interest without necessarily letting on that I have an actual fetish for it.

But yeah I think situations like that are pretty common as I think that women just have accepted the fact that men will pee everywhere. It's frustrating when you have to go to the bathroom and they are doing it right around you but I think in most cases they aren't doing it simply to torture the women but just because it's easy for them to do and you really can't blame them for that even if it is frustrating!
