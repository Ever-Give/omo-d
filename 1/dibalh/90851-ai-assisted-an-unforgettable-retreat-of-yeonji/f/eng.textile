Hi readers, I'm Yeonji. This is a story of myself, about what happened yesterday. Yesterday was a college club's retreat, or called MT in Korean culture. I have a crush in the club, and we were getting closer in recent days.

Yesterday morning, the sun painted the sky with hues of tangerine as I eagerly packed my backpack for the club retreat. Excitement fluttered in my chest like a restless butterfly, as thoughts of spending the day with my crush, Jaehyun, consumed my mind.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the aroma of toast, wafting from the kitchen where my mother, ever supportive, prepared a hearty breakfast.

"Yeonji, have a wonderful time today!", she said, her voice brimming with warmth.

Gazing at my closet, I pondered the perfect attire for the day's adventure. A disarray of clothes hung before me, ranging from vibrant sundresses to casual jeans. Despite the pressure to conform to societal expectations, I refused to sacrifice my comfort for the sake of appearances. My fingers brushed past the flowery patterns and settled on a pair of well-worn denim shorts that felt like a second skin. Paired with a loose, breezy blouse, it was an ensemble that captured my individuality. I smiled, content with my choice. Both matches very well on me.

While have some spare time before an appointment time, I opened a refridgerator. I, who believed in the superstition that drinking a lot of water makes me look pretty, drank three cups of water in a row from the morning. With a satisfied "glug, glug, glug", I guzzled down the refreshing water, feeling its coolness cascade down my throat. The tinkling sound of ice cubes swirling in the glass echoed through the kitchen, harmonizing with my contented sigh. Each gulp brought a renewed sense of vitality, as if the water itself possessed magical properties that would enhance my beauty. Quenching my thirst, I closed the fridge door and relished the lingering taste of purity on my lips. Only thing came up in my mind was that I want to appeal myself to Jaehyun. I wanted to look pretty.

We met in the muscial club a year ago. Since then, we sang together, danced together, and practice acting together. As the memory of our musical club adventures danced through my mind, I felt a surge of determination to present my best self to Jaehyun. It wasn't solely about physical appearance but also about the radiant energy that exuded from within. With renewed confidence, I retreated to my room and spent extra care styling my hair, the gentle hum of the hairdryer enveloping the space. I chose a touch of subtle makeup, accentuating my features with a delicate brush of blush and a hint of shimmering lip gloss. In the mirror's reflection, my eyes sparkled with anticipation, ready to seize the day and capture Jaehyun's attention.

After finishing my makeup, I leaved home and headed to a club room. Entering the club room, I was greeted by the bustling energy of my fellow club members. Laughter and animated conversations filled the air as we prepared for our journey. The room was a vibrant mosaic of colors, with instruments strewn about and posters adorning the walls, reflecting our shared passion for music and performance.

Jaehyun stood near a stack of amplifiers, engrossed in adjusting the settings, his brows furrowed in concentration. I couldn't help but feel a flutter in my chest, knowing that we would soon embark on an adventure together.

"Hi Jaehyun! What's up?", I asked.

Jaehyun turned toward me, a warm smile gracing his lips. His eyes, a mesmerizing shade of deep brown, lit up as he saw me.

"Hey, Yeonji! Just making sure everything's set for the trip. Excited for today?" he replied, his voice carrying a hint of excitement.

The sound of his voice sent a shiver of anticipation down my spine, like a melodious chord resonating through the room.

"Absolutely!" I replied, matching his enthusiasm.

Our gazes locked for a fleeting moment, and in that instant, an unspoken connection formed between us, as if the universe itself acknowledged our mutual affection.

"Ok, then let's get in!" Jaehyun shouted so that everyone can hear.

At that time, I missed a small thing: little did I know was that those water I drank this moring was quite a lot of amount to hold, and we were heading to a place which took three hours of driving.

With an air of excitement, I followed Jaehyun's lead and made my way onto the bus, my thoughts consumed by the upcoming adventure. As the engine roared to life, the bus began to roll forward, propelling us toward our destination. The hum of the tires against the road created a soothing rhythm, lulling some of us into a comfortable daze.

Unbeknownst to me, within the confines of my body, the water I had consumed earlier began to stir, its presence growing increasingly noticeable with every passing mile. Yet, my attention remained fixed on the anticipation of the day, oblivious to the impending discomfort that awaited me.

"Jaehyun, can I seat next to you?" I mustered up the courage to ask.

Jaehyun turned to me, a warm smile gracing his face.

"Of course, Yeonji! I'd love to have you by my side," he replied, his voice filled with genuine warmth.

With a flutter in my heart, I made my way toward the vacant seat beside him. The soft fabric of the bus seat welcomed me as I settled in, a reassuring presence amidst the growing unease within my body. Sitting beside Jaehyun, our shoulders barely grazing, a sense of comfort enveloped me, as if our proximity held a promise of unspoken connection.

But very slowly, the water I drank earlier was filling my bladder. Yet, it was unnoticable, I chatted and giggled while having a talk with Jaehyun. Amidst the lively chatter on the bus, Jaehyun and I engaged in a playful conversation.

"So, have you thought about what songs we should perform at the next club event?" Jaehyun asked, his eyes twinkling with excitement.

I giggled, feeling at ease in his presence.

"I was actually thinking of doing a medley of our favorite K-pop songs. What do you think?" I suggested, my voice laced with enthusiasm.

Jaehyun's face lit up, mirroring my excitement.

"That sounds like a fantastic idea! It'll showcase our love for K-pop and allow us to showcase our vocal harmonies. I'm all in!" he exclaimed, his words punctuated by a light chuckle.

As our conversation continued, laughter intermingled with our words, creating a symphony of joy that resonated throughout the bus. Little did I know, the urgency in my voice masked the growing pressure within my bladder, a silent reminder of the water I had consumed earlier.

An hour past, and the speed of the bus decreased, and finally halted. It was a beginning of a long traffic jam. I was little bit nervous at that point, since I was feeling urge to relieve myself in a bathroom. I felt the water I drank rattle in my stomach. Looking back now, drinking three glasses of water in a row was stupid.

As the bus came to a standstill, trapped in the clutches of a relentless traffic jam, a wave of unease washed over me. The urgency within my bladder intensified, and I couldn't help but curse my imprudence in drinking those three glasses of water earlier. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead, berating myself for my lack of foresight.

"What was I thinking? Three glasses of water before a long ride? That was foolish," I muttered under my breath, my words lost amidst the chatter of frustrated passengers. Regret gnawed at my conscience as I scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of a nearby restroom.

The rattle and sloshing of the water within my stomach served as an unwelcome reminder of my predicament, like an impatient percussionist demanding attention. With each passing minute, the discomfort grew, amplifying my nervousness. Time seemed to stretch endlessly, and I silently hoped for the traffic to ease, yearning for the relief that awaited me at the journey's end.

It was only a half way to our destination, and I felt despair to the fact that I cannot go to bathroom for at least one more hour.

"You look nervous. Is something wrong?" Jaehyun asked.

I forced a smile, attempting to conceal my inner turmoil from Jaehyun's discerning gaze.

"Oh, no, I'm fine. Just a little tired from the journey so far," I replied, my voice betraying a hint of strain.

Jaehyun's brows furrowed with concern as he leaned in closer, his eyes searching mine for any signs of distress.

"Are you sure? You seem a bit off. If there's anything bothering you, you can always tell me, Yeonji," he offered, his voice gentle and reassuring.

I shook my head, offering a dismissive wave of my hand.

"No, really, it's nothing. Just need to stretch my legs a bit," I replied, my words a feeble attempt to downplay my discomfort.

It was a mix of shyness and the fear of burdening him with my predicament that kept me from revealing the truth. But it was no good. The traffic did not seem to be ease, and my urge was getting stronger. With each passing moment, the struggle to hold my urgent bodily need became more arduous. Beads of perspiration dotted my forehead as my muscles clenched in a desperate attempt to maintain control. The rhythmic drumming of my heartbeat echoed in my ears, synchronizing with the relentless ticking of the clock. Every bump on the road felt like a jolt to my already strained bladder, testing the limits of my endurance. My legs fidgeted restlessly, the tapping of my foot against the floorboards a silent plea for relief. Yet, the traffic showed no mercy, prolonging my agony and pushing me closer to the precipice of surrender.

"Yeonji, I don't think you are okay. Are you need to go to a toilet?" Jaehyun asked.

My face reddened as I heard a word "toilet".

Caught off guard by Jaehyun's direct question, my face flushed crimson, betraying my inner embarrassment. I mustered a feeble smile, attempting to brush off his concern.

"Oh, it's really nothing, Jaehyun. Just a small inconvenience. I can manage," I replied, my voice strained with a mixture of discomfort and unease.

Avoiding his gaze, I focused on the passing scenery outside the bus window, desperately hoping for a miraculous resolution to my predicament. But deep down, the truth weighed heavily upon me, and the longing for a restroom grew more fervent with every passing second.

Despite my all efforts, time was not my side. I felt I was loosing control.

A warm trickle escaped in a second, betraying my futile attempts to maintain control. Panic surged through my veins as I realized the inevitable had happened. Shame and humiliation engulfed me, my cheeks burning with embarrassment. My mind raced with a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, a mixture of frustration, disappointment, and a deep sense of vulnerability. Yet, the damage was unnoticable, and I should find a way to prevent a full-blown accident.

Taking a deep breath, I mustered the courage to confide in Jaehyun, realizing that honesty was the only way forward. My voice quivered slightly as I turned to him, meeting his concerned gaze.

"Jaehyun, I have to tell you something... I've been trying to hide it, but I'm in a bit of a predicament," I admitted, my voice laced with a mix of vulnerability and humility.

His expression softened, his concern deepening.

"What is it, Yeonji? You can trust me," he reassured, his voice gentle and understanding.

I hesitated for a moment, the weight of my confession heavy upon me. With a shaky voice, I finally let my guard down and revealed the truth.

"I... I really need to use the restroom. I've been trying to hold it, but it's getting unbearable," I admitted, my words laden with a blend of apology and desperation.

As the confession hung in the air, a mixture of relief and anxiety coursed through me. I awaited Jaehyun's response, uncertain of how he would react to my vulnerable admission.

"Oh, that's bad..." Jaehyun whispered. "How much longer do you think you can hold it?"

My heart sank at the realization that time was running out, and my ability to hold on was dwindling rapidly. The urgency in Jaehyun's voice mirrored my own growing desperation. I bit my lip, attempting to gauge the limits of my endurance.

"I... I don't think I can hold it for much longer," I confessed, my voice trembling with a mix of apprehension and vulnerability.

Tears welled up in my eyes, the culmination of the discomfort and the fear of disappointing Jaehyun.

"I'll ask a bus driver to stop somewhere." Jaehyun said to me with nervous face.

"You can do this, Yeonji." I nodded unspoken, tears welled up in my eyes.

With a mixture of gratitude and relief, I nodded at Jaehyun's words, silently thanking him for his understanding and support. But my body was at the limit.

The tears that welled up in my eyes mirrored the growing dampness that spread across my denim shorts. Each movement, no matter how slight, seemed to coax more and more pee to escape from my desperate bladder, dampening the fabric and leaving an undeniable mark of my vulnerability.

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, the sensation of the warm liquid against my skin only amplifying my discomfort. A sense of helplessness washed over me as I struggled to maintain composure, the knowledge that my body had betrayed me adding to the weight of my humiliation. The scent of urine, though faint, lingered in the air, and I averted my gaze, not wanting to meet the eyes of my fellow passengers who may have noticed the unmistakable evidence of my struggle.

"Jaehyun, please don't look....", I cried. My floodgate was no more closed. I was having an accident, right beside him.

Tears streamed down my cheeks as I mustered the courage to confess my vulnerability.

"This can't be happening... It's so embarrasing..." I pleaded, my voice choked with a mix of embarrassment and resignation. And then, it happened. The floodgates that had held back the torrent of my desperation finally gave way, releasing a torrential downpour of urine.

A soft, steady patter resonated within the bus, like raindrops against a windowpane. The sound of trickling and splattering filled the air, mingling with the hushed whispers and gasps of the passengers. The dampness against my skin grew, spreading like an unwelcome stain, marking the undeniable truth of my accident. The sensation was both mortifying and oddly liberating, a release of pent-up tension and shame that had weighed me down.

I closed my eyes, unable to bear the sight of Jaehyun's potential disappointment, the image of my soiled shorts etched in my mind. My heart ached with a mix of embarrassment and humiliation.

Finally, I looked down on the lower half of the body, bracing myself for the aftermath of my accident. My denim shorts, once a symbol of confidence and comfort, were now marred by the undeniable evidence of my vulnerability. They clung to my damp skin, the fabric darker and discolored where the urine had soaked through.

Jaehyun said nothing. He looked shocked.

A mixture of emotions welled up within me as I surveyed the scene. Embarrassment and shame washed over me, threatening to engulf my senses.

With a determined sigh, I reached into my bag and pulled out a spare pair of clothes that I had packed for emergencies. With the discreet assistance of a kind fellow club member, I found solace in the act of changing, discreetly shielding myself from further judgment or prying eyes.

As I finished changing into fresh clothes, I turned to face Jaehyun, my heart heavy with anticipation. His silence etched across his face spoke volumes, stirring a mix of anxiety and vulnerability within me. The weight of his unspoken words hung in the air, and I braced myself for his reaction, unsure of how he would respond to this unforeseen turn of events.

Seconds stretched into an agonizing silence, and I found myself yearning for any sign of understanding or reassurance. Would this accident tarnish our connection, or could it serve as a testament to the strength of our bond?

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Jaehyun's expression softened, his eyes reflecting a complex mix of surprise, empathy, and compassion. In that moment, I sensed a shift in his demeanor, a realization that accidents happen, and that true connection transcended such fleeting moments of embarrassment.

Without uttering a word, he stepped forward and embraced me, offering a comforting hug that conveyed more understanding than any spoken response could. In that embrace, I felt a renewed sense of trust and acceptance, a reassurance that our friendship could weather even the most unexpected storms.

Sometimes, it is in the face of vulnerability that we find the deepest connections, and as Jaehyun held me, I knew that our bond had grown stronger, forged through shared experiences and the unwavering support we offered one another.

And so, the story of my eventful college club retreat came to an end. It was a tale of unexpected challenges, vulnerability, and the power of friendship. Though the journey took unforeseen twists and turns, it ultimately led to a deeper connection with Jaehyun and a greater understanding of myself.

As time passed, the memory of that fateful bus ride faded, replaced by the cherished moments we shared in the club. We continued to sing, dance, and practice acting together, with a newfound sense of camaraderie and acceptance.

Looking back, I realized that life's most memorable stories often emerge from the unexpected, the moments that test our resilience and reveal our true selves. It was a reminder to embrace vulnerability, to trust in the bonds we form, and to find strength in the face of adversity.

And so, with the closing of this chapter, I turned my attention to the next chapter of my life, ready to embrace whatever adventures and challenges lay ahead, knowing that I had learned valuable lessons from the remarkable events of that unforgettable retreat.

The end.
