Given the roleplay section of the site has been removed, i’ve thought about sending a message here for a little while and decided on it now, i’m basically just looking for people to rp omo with, im gonna write a few things about me below

I am bisexual with a slight female lean so most genders work for me though i dont play male characters often so there may be some learning curve there as i get used to it

As a person who irl struggles with bladder issues, i like my characters to mirror that in a similar way, which is why you may find during the rp that they have accidents often because they just simply can’t hold it, maybe even in similar situations that i have been in, this can sometimes veer out from the omo side of things and i prefer omo that is more tucked away, a part of the story rather than the main focus as i feel it just gets a little dull when it’s just omo the whole time and a good story goes a long way!

Finally, i am a sub and struggle quite badly to play more dominant characters which can lead to me often wanting to play either alongside another sub or switch and taking turns in both having a slight dominant role in the relationship between said characters or just a dom overall rather than having to take that role myself as i struggle and don’t really find much if any fun in playing it a lot of the time

Iif any of this is a deal breaker i am sorry, but if not; i’d love to rp with anyone on here!! i’m gonna list some of my more liked fandoms down below just in case people don’t want to do ocs or a original story

Arcane, wednesday (the show), stranger things, cobra kai, lucifer (the show), marvel (as a franchise), dc (as a franchise aka most characters work for me if they do for you), star wars, doctor who (one of my favs please someone like this too), outer banks, ginny and georgia

There is some scenarios i really enjoy too, being mainly a theatre kid, i love that particular setting but also post apocalyptic or action based settings work as well, thank you for reading and i hope if you do want to roleplay, that we can work something out!
