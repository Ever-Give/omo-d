I'm looking for a story I read a long time ago. Sadly I don't remember many of the details but It was a story about a teacher who was stuck in the classroom during a lockdown drill and was desperate to pee. I remember at the end a student spills a water bottle to conceal the teacher wetting. Any help finding this would be appreciated.
