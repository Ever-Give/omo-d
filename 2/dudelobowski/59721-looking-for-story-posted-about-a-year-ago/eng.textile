About a year ago, maybe a bit more there was a post in fiction/fanfiction that had a fantastic story!

In it, a guy winds up at a bar and bumps into an old friend who's a girl who moved away for school but comes back into town. They drink at the bar and they talk about an accident or something and it culminates in them going to the top of a hill at night where he discovers that she already wet her panties at the bar and she wanted him to find them.

I wish i had more details but this story has been on my mind for weeks now and I just can't dig it up through keyword searches, etc. Any help would be appreciated!
