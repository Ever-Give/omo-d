Here are some short "stories" in the form of the kind of moral choices you might see in a cRPG. These aren't really part of a bigger project, just for fun. Maybe I'll make more at some point, maybe I won't. Which choice would you make, if you were playing this inexplicable pee-desperation fantasy cRPG?

"Commander, I-I know I said I could handle the proposed bathroom schedule while traversing the Molten Spires. It shames me to admit this, but I have nearly reached my limit. P-please, I don't want to risk the safety of the party by w-wetting myself..."

The paladin is looking at you like a pet who has done something wrong. Her face is flush, and despite her heavy armor you can tell she can barely stand straight. The proud and strong woman has been reduced to the desperate little girl in front of you.

1. (Neutral Good): You are quick to carry the heaviest burden, Paladin. Because of your endurance, other members of the party were able to relieve themselves in these dangerous lands. I will arrange for a break immediately.

2. (Lawful Neutral): Very well. I will arrange a break for you as soon as I can without causing a major disruption. I hope this experience has taught you where your own limits lie. Do not repeat this lapse in judgement.

3. (Chaotic Neutral): I'll distract everyone, and you can go pee behind a bush. That way, nobody else will know of your mistake!

4. (Lawful Evil): I will pretend I didn't hear that, and you will control yourself until the time for your break comes. The consequences of your failure will be far more painful than whatever discomfort you feel right now. Is that clear, Paladin?

You enter the queen's tent. It's the largest and most lavish in the war camp, though the interior is clearly decorated for war rather than grandeur. The queen bites her lip as you enter, worried. She usually wears armor and clothing similar to the paladins, but her breastplate is currently mounted on an armor stand. You can tell she is very tense.

"A-ah...! Commander. I have a very delicate mission for you. Y-you mustn't tell anyone about this."

The queen squirms, and swallows.

"I use a blessed chamber pot to relieve myself while avoiding the curse of this corrpted land, but during the last attack its magic was disrupted. Please, commander, I can only trust you with this. You must restore the chamber pot without anyone learning of it, and quickly! I am at my wit's end!

1. (Lawful Neutral) Very well. It would not do for the common soldiers to learn of this. I will restore the chamber pot with haste, but in return you must hold on until I return.

2. (Lawful Good) I will help you, but I cannot make this mission my highest concern. We are at war, your majesty. I will help you relieve yourself somewhere privately, then I will find a way to repair your pot.

3. (Neutral Good) I can't believe you would use an artifact like this to relieve yourself while the common soldier is forced to desperately endure! I will help you, but I won't prioritize this over the needs of the army. I will find some other way to let you relieve yourself until we can fix your chamber pot.

4. (Neutral Evil) Of course, your majesty. But only on one condition; after the pot is fixed, I will be the one to determine when you are allowed to use the pot. It wouldn't do to have a queen who can't control herself, after all.

5. (Chaotic Neutral) I will help you, on one condition. You must relieve yourself into the soldier's latrine first. It would do the soldiers some good to finally see their queen is human like the rest of us - this charade has gone on far too long.

“C-Curse you crusader! Your allies are doomed! Those among you who haven’t already been corrupted will bleed out into the dirt within a month!“

The demoness is locked up inside her cell. She strains fiercely against her cold iron restraints. One of the clerics has placed a sealing spell on her, preventing her from releasing her cursed urine. Her bladder has become swollen and taut during her captivity, and despite the tough front she is putting up, you can see she is in agony.

1. (Lawful Evil) Perhaps I’ll play with you, like you played with so many of our soldiers? If you’re good, maybe I can even find a way to help you relieve that aching bladder of yours?

2. (Lawful Neutral) You’ve made your bed, and now you must lie in it, demon. I doubt I can appeal to any goodness or righteousness within you, but perhaps you will eventually be motivated to tell the crusade what you know to be relieved of your cursed bladder. It would take an effort on our part to make that possible, safely, so make it worth it by providing us with the information we need.

3. (Chaotic Good) Even wicked creatures deserve mercy. I will try to find a way to allow you to relieve yourself without endangering our camp. You must be hurting, having such a full bladder and being unable to pee.

4. (Chaotic Evil) Relieve yourself in front of the demoness.
