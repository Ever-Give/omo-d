@Squatwaffle

I'm glad that you enjoyed my omorashi novels. I have pretty much done exclusively self-publishing which I have to admit is not very profitable but anyone can do it on Amazon. I'm currently trying to go through a traditional publisher but that's more with my serious stuff and not my fetish stuff that I write under my pseudonym. I do hope to put all of my stories into a collection one day, which I should probably do soon because the document where I keep all of them is over 200,000 words of stories so it's already long enough to be a pretty large sized collection.

The problem is that when I put every story in a collection based on topic and wait for a long time before getting around to reading and editing and publishing them to keep putting it off and putting it off. Right now everything is still freely available in my blogs but I do hope to make like an omorashi anthology collection of all of my stories, when I'll get around to doing that I can't say but it probably won't be anytime soon LOL
