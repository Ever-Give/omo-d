Eun-bi opened her eyes while checking time displayed on her phone.

"Oh my, I'm late! God, I forgot to set alarm yesterday.."

Eun-bi hurriedly got out of bed, her messy hair falling across her sleepy eyes. She quickly threw on her favorite oversized sweater and slipped into a pair of worn-out sneakers. As she dashed out of her tiny apartment, the sound of her keys jingling echoed through the quiet hallway, blending with the distant hum of traffic outside. With each step, she could feel the morning chill seeping through the soles of her shoes, awakening her senses to the bustling city around her. Eun-bi's heart raced as she ran towards the bus stop, hoping to catch a ride to work before her boss noticed her tardiness. But she soon realized that she left her card key. Eun-bi at first thinking of go back to her room and grab key, but she changed her mind.

"I only need it to open few rooms, it is more important to go work as soon as possible!"

Eun-bi made a split-second decision and continued running towards the bus stop, leaving behind her card key. She knew she would have to rely on the kindness of her co-workers to let her into the restricted areas of the office. As she reached the bustling intersection, the pedestrian signal turned red, forcing her to wait impatiently with a group of strangers. A street performer nearby strummed his guitar, filling the air with a melodic tune that momentarily eased Eun-bi's anxiety. Finally, the signal changed, and Eun-bi sprinted across the street, her breath quickening with each step, determined to make it to work on time.

Eun-bi, dressed in pink oversized sweater and beige trousers, looked like a novice and young office lady. She was pleased to see the bus coming into the bus stop right after she arrived. Eun-bi boarded the bus, joining the sea of commuters. She grabbed onto the handrail for stability as the vehicle jerked into motion, its engine rumbling in the background. The bus was filled with a symphony of murmurs and the occasional cellphone ringtone, blending into a harmonious chaos. Eun-bi's eyes darted around, searching for an empty seat, but the crowded bus offered no respite. As she stood near the front, gripping her phone tightly, she caught a glimpse of a familiar faceâ€”a fellow colleague from her office. She shyly smiled and exchanged a nod of acknowledgement, finding solace in the shared familiarity amidst the chaos of the morning commute.

His name was Dohyun, working in a department next to her. He shyly offered Eun-be a iced coffee.

"You look exhausted already. Drink this, and cheer up."

Eun-bi's eyes widened with surprise as she accepted the iced coffee from Dohyun. The cold touch of the cup sent a refreshing sensation through her fingers. She couldn't help but feel a flutter of excitement at the unexpected gesture.

"Thank you, Dohyun! You're a lifesaver," she said, a grateful smile spreading across her face.

The aroma of the coffee filled the air, mingling with the subtle scent of morning dew that had seeped into the bus. With each sip, the cool liquid rejuvenated her senses, easing the remnants of her earlier rush. Eun-bi glanced at Dohyun, their eyes meeting for a brief moment, and she couldn't help but wonder if this small act of kindness was the start of something more.

Eun-bi said a delightful bye to Dohyun and hurried to her office. She stepped into the office, her heart still racing from the morning's events. She hurriedly made her way towards her desk, trying to blend in unnoticed. But just as she settled into her chair, her boss, Mr. Lee, appeared in front of her with a stern expression.

"Eun-bi, you're late again," he said, his voice laced with disapproval.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Lee. I overslept and--"

He cut her off, his tone unforgiving.

"This is becoming a habit, Eun-bi. Punctuality is crucial in this company."

Eun-bi's cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she lowered her gaze.

"I understand, sir. It won't happen again," she promised, her voice filled with determination.

Mr. Lee sighed, seemingly relenting.

"Make sure it doesn't. We have high expectations of you, Eun-bi. Now, get to work."

Eun-bi nodded, her spirits dampened but her resolve strengthened. She knew she had to prove herself and regain her boss's trust. As she settled into her tasks, the sound of typing and hushed office conversations filled the air, serving as a constant reminder of the demanding world she inhabited.

"No break until lunch time, understand?" Mr. Lee said with a tension in his voice.

Eun-bi nodded, her determination unwavering despite the lack of reprieve.

"Yes, Mr. Lee," she replied, her voice steady and composed.

She knew that this day would require unwavering focus and dedication. With a sense of resilience, she dove into her work, immersing herself in spreadsheets, emails, and deadlines.

Hours passed in a blur as Eun-bi diligently tackled her tasks, the rhythmic clacking of keyboards and occasional ringing of phones providing a backdrop to her concentration. The morning sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm glow through the office windows, but Eun-bi remained steadfast, pushing through the challenges that came her way.

As the clock finally struck noon, announcing the arrival of lunchtime, Eun-bi took a deep breath, her fingers hovering above the keyboard. She realized that her commitment had paid off; she had managed to meet her targets and complete her assignments on time. Glancing at Mr. Lee, she awaited his nod of approval, hoping for a moment of respite before the afternoon's tasks demanded her attention once more.

At that point of time, Eun-bi slightly needed to go toilet, as the coffee she formerly drank speeded up the pace of urine formation than the usual.

"Eun-bi, can you bring the materials for the afternoon meeting from the supply room before lunch?" Mr. Lee asked.

"Yes, of course. Have a good lunch Mr. Lee."

Eun-bi replied, thinking to go toilet right after finishing her duty.

Eun-bi hurriedly made her way to the supply room, a slight sense of urgency urging her on. She carefully gathered the materials needed for the afternoon meeting, juggling them in her arms. But as she closed the door behind her, a sinking feeling washed over her as she heard the sound,

"Cling!"

She realized that she had left her card key at home, and the supply room door automatically locked upon closing.

Panic gripped Eun-bi's chest as she tugged at the door, hoping for a miracle. The room was filled with an eerie silence, and the walls seemed to close in on her. Her mind raced with thoughts of being trapped and missing the important meeting.

Frantically, she reached for her phone, contemplating who to call for help. As she dialed her colleague's number, she could hear her own rapid heartbeat pulsating in her ears. The sound of the dial tone echoed, magnifying her anxiety as she awaited a response that would determine her fate within the confined space of the supply room. However, to her disappointment, no one answered her call. To make matter worse, her phone was about to be discharged.

"Oh, no! I locked myself in the supply room.. What should I do?"

Eun-bi's heart sank as the battery icon on her phone flashed red, indicating its imminent demise. With each passing second, the chances of anyone receiving her distress call dwindled further. The dim light in the supply room cast eerie shadows on the shelves stacked with stationary and office supplies, intensifying the feeling of entrapment.

A sudden gust of wind rattled the small window near the ceiling, causing Eun-bi to startle. She strained her ears, hoping for any sign of rescue, but all she heard was the distant echo of footsteps and muffled conversations from the bustling office outside. Time seemed to stretch endlessly, amplifying her growing unease.

As minutes turned into what felt like hours, Eun-bi's bladder urged for release, the urgency becoming unbearable. She clenched her fists, trying to ignore the discomfort, but the pressure continued to mount. The stifling air in the room added to her uneasiness, and a bead of perspiration trickled down her forehead. Trapped, alone, and in desperate need of help, Eun-bi's predicament seemed to intensify with each passing moment.

"Is anyone outside? Please, someone, open the door..!" Eun-bi shouted.

But no one was outside. She realized it was lunch time, and she had to wait until people came back. Eun-bi slumped against the supply room door, her voice echoing within the confines of the empty hallway. "Why did I forget my card key? How could I be so careless?" Her voice trembled with frustration, mixing with the silence that enveloped her. "I should have checked my phone's battery earlier. Now, I'm truly trapped."

As the minutes stretched on, Eun-bi's mind wandered into a worrisome realm. She started pacing back and forth in the cramped space, the sound of her footsteps echoing hollowly.

"What if no one realizes I'm missing? What if they think I've left for the day? What if..." Her thoughts trailed off, the fear of being forgotten gnawing at her.

Desperation took hold, and Eun-bi found herself engaging in one-sided conversations, hoping that by speaking aloud, her solitude would be less suffocating.

"I'm sure they'll notice I'm gone soon. They'll come looking for me. Right?"

Her voice wavered, doubts seeping into her words.

"I just have to be patient. Help will come. It has to come."

The silence that followed her words seemed to mock her, intensifying the weight of her isolation. Making matter worse, the pressure in her bladder constantly intensified, she crossed her legs tight. Eun-bi's crossed legs offered little relief as the pressure in her bladder reached its peak. She gritted her teeth, her voice strained as she whispered to herself,

"Just hold on a little longer, Eun-bi. You can do this. You have to."

But the relentless urgency became unbearable, and her desperation grew. She shifted from foot to foot, trying to distract herself from the discomfort, but it only amplified her predicament.

"Why didn't I go to the toilet earlier? This is a nightmare," she muttered through clenched teeth, her voice laced with frustration.

As she glanced around the dimly lit supply room, her eyes fell upon a small bucket tucked away in a corner. She hesitated, contemplating the unthinkable.

"No, I can't... Can I?"

Eun-bi's face flushed with embarrassment at the mere thought, torn between her dignity and the impending sense of relief. The silence of the room mocked her, leaving her alone with her internal struggle and an ever-increasing urgency.

"No, never.. the one who opens the room absolutely realize what I did.."

Eun-bi sighed, stepping back and forth in desperation.

"I can hold this, a little bit more and someone will open that door. Just a little bit more Eun-bi."

Eun-bi's determination wavered as the seconds ticked by, each passing moment pushing her closer to her breaking point. The tormenting whispers in her mind grew louder, testing her resolve.

"What if no one comes? What if I can't hold it any longer?" Her voice quivered, mirroring her wavering hope.

She pressed her hands against her abdomen, trying to suppress the urgency.

"Come on, Eun-bi, you are not a baby. You can handle this." she muttered, her voice laced with desperation.

But as the pressure in her bladder reached its peak, her strained whispers turned into a plea.

"Ugh.. Please, someone, anyone... open this door!"

The sound of her own voice bounced off the walls, her desperation echoing through the empty hallway, mocking her as she teetered on the edge of surrender. In the absence of rescue, Eun-bi's ordeal seemed to intensify, the battle against her body's demands becoming a relentless struggle for survival.

Eun-bi, squatting in front of the locked door, desperately looked up the clock on the wall.

"Uh...It's still 12:15... Lunch time ends at 1 pm... I cannot hold until then.."

Eun-bi stood up and poked around the room to find any solution to open the door. Eun-bi's eyes darted around the supply room, scanning the shelves and searching for anything that could potentially aid her escape. Her voice trembled with a mix of frustration and panic as she muttered to herself,

"There must be something, anything that can help me get out of here."

Her hands rummaged through stationery, files, and discarded office supplies, desperately hoping to uncover a hidden tool or a forgotten spare key. But as her search yielded no results, a sense of hopelessness washed over her.

"Why is there nothing? Why am I so unlucky?"

Eun-bi's shoulders slumped, her breath shaky with defeat.

"I can't believe this is happening. I never expected to be trapped like this, in such a helpless situation."

The silence that followed her words seemed to magnify her predicament, amplifying her desperation and the weight of her circumstances. Alone, with time ticking against her, Eun-bi's struggle for freedom became increasingly dire.

"Ug...uh...uh..."

The room was silence, only the ticking of clock and the breathing of Eun-bi was audible. Eun-bi's distress grew with each passing moment, her breathing becoming shallow and rapid. She tried to steady herself, but the unrelenting pressure in her bladder was now overwhelming. Her voice, strained and filled with despair, escaped in a whisper.

"I can't... I can't hold it any longer."

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for any possible solution, but the silence mocked her, magnifying her isolation and the impending sense of defeat.

"Please, someone, anyone..."

Eun-bi's voice cracked, desperation saturating her words. The room remained indifferent, its stillness an agonizing reminder of her entrapment.

Tears welled up in Eun-bi's eyes as she sank to her knees, defeated.

"I'm sorry... I tried... I couldn't... hold on..."

The words escaped her lips as a final plea, a surrender to her body's relentless demands. In the face of her worsening situation, Eun-bi's resolve crumbled, leaving her in a vulnerable state of resignation and a desperate longing for rescue.

She felt a warm trickle escape, but she was able to stop the full accident. She checked her crotch and luckily, the damage was unnoticable. The pressure was little bit released, but Eun-bi cannot stop concentrating. Eun-bi let out a shaky breath of relief as she realized the accident had been averted, the damage minimal. Yet, the reprieve was short-lived as she glanced at the clock, realizing that there was still a considerable amount of time left until the lunch break ended.

Her voice, tinged with desperation, whispered in the suffocating silence of the room,

"I managed to hold it once, but how much longer can I endure? I can't let my guard down."

The weight of her predicament settled heavily on her shoulders, her determination to maintain control now mingled with an overwhelming sense of vulnerability.

"I have to stay focused. I can't afford another slip-up," she murmured, her words a feeble attempt to bolster her crumbling resilience.

The room, devoid of any solace, seemed to close in around her, amplifying her discomfort and the ticking of the clock that ticked away mercilessly. With each passing second, Eun-bi's battle against her body's demands became increasingly arduous, testing her mental and physical limits.

Eun-bi checked her phone battery. It was 2%, meaning only one more call for help was available. She desperately searched in her phone number list, that would catch her call. Dohyun's face came up in her mind.

"Please, Dohyun, catch my call!"

Eun-bi's trembling fingers hovered over Dohyun's name on her phone screen. She pressed the call button, her heart pounding with a mixture of hope and apprehension. As the dial tone rang through the tiny room, every second felt like an eternity, the fate of her plea resting on the connection.

"Come on, Dohyun," she whispered, her voice filled with urgency.

"Answer, please answer."

Finally, a faint voice crackled through the speaker.

"Hello? Eun-bi, is that you?"

Relief flooded Eun-bi's being as she mustered all her strength to respond, her voice quivering with a mix of anxiety and gratitude.

"Dohyun, it's me! I'm trapped in the supply room. Please, I need your help! I really really need to go to the bathroom!"

Dohyun's voice filled with concern.

"Eun-bi, don't worry. I'll come right away. Just hold on a little longer."

Eun-bi's eyes welled up with tears, a glimmer of hope breaking through the darkness that had consumed her. She whispered her thanks and assurance, the sound of Dohyun's voice providing solace amidst the isolation. As she waited for his arrival, a newfound determination settled within her, bolstered by the knowledge that she was no longer alone in her struggle.

"How much will you take? I'm on my limit.. I can't hold any longer..." She asked desperately.

"Wow that's terrible.. I'm out now, so I'll be there in 15 minutes, so just hold on a little longer."

15 minutes. Eun-bi's final battle had started. Eun-bi's heart sank at the prospect of enduring another 15 agonizing minutes. Her voice, filled with a mix of urgency and desperation, trembled as she spoke to herself.

"Fifteen minutes... I have to hold on... I can't let go now."

Her mind raced, thoughts consumed by the relentless pressure within her. Every passing second seemed to stretch into eternity, the weight of her bladder intensifying with each tick of the clock.

"Just a little longer, Eun-bi. You've come this far. You can make it."

But as the seconds ticked by, her resolve began to waver. Doubt crept in, whispering tauntingly in her ear.

"Can you really hold on? What if you can't? What if it becomes unbearable?"

Eun-bi bit her lip, her face contorted with a mix of determination and fear.

"I have to... I must find the strength within me. I won't let this defeat me."

As she struggled against her body's relentless demands, Eun-bi's battle against time became a test of endurance and willpower. With each agonizing minute that passed, the need for relief threatened to overpower her, challenging her resilience and forcing her to confront the limits of her physical and mental strength.

A sudden wave of urge overwelmed Eun-bi. One more spurt of warm liquid escaped. Eun-bi made her all effort to stop. Eun-bi gasped as another spurt of warm liquid escaped, the evidence of her struggle. She clenched her muscles, her voice strained as she whispered desperately to herself,

"No, no, I can't let it happen again. I have to hold on, just a little longer."

The urge intensified, threatening to overpower her resolve. Beads of perspiration formed on her forehead as she fought against her body's demands.

"I won't give up. I won't let this defeat me," she muttered through gritted teeth, her voice a mixture of determination and desperation.

Every fiber of her being screamed for release, urging her to surrender to the inevitable. But Eun-bi refused to succumb, her willpower fueling her resistance.

"I've come too far. I can endure this. I have to."

With each passing moment, the battle within her raged on, the struggle against her body's urges pushing her to the brink. As she fought to maintain control, Eun-bi's strength was tested, and she became a testament to the indomitable human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

Five minutes past. Ten more minutes to go. Eun-bi continued her endurance. The minutes dragged on, each one feeling like an eternity as Eun-bi's endurance wore thin. Her voice, a mere whisper, conveyed her increasing desperation.

"Five minutes... ten more to go. Hold on, Eun-bi, just a little longer."

The pressure within her intensified, becoming an unrelenting torment. Doubt and fear clouded her thoughts, testing her mental fortitude.

"Can I make it? Can I withstand this for ten more minutes?" Her voice trembled with uncertainty, the weight of her predicament pressing down on her.

She gritted her teeth, her hands trembling at her sides.

"I have to keep going. I can't give in now," she muttered, her words a desperate mantra to stave off the encroaching despair.

With every passing second, her body's demands seemed to grow stronger, threatening to break through her fragile defenses. Eun-bi fought against the overwhelming urge, her resilience pushed to its limits. She closed her eyes, summoning every ounce of willpower she could muster, knowing that the next ten minutes would be an agonizing test of her determination and strength.

Five more minutes passed. Eun-bi squatted on the floor, holding her crotch with her most force. Her face was reddened, and her pretty eyes were filled with tears. She knew that she does not have much time left. Eun-bi's body trembled with the effort of holding back the inevitable. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks, mixing with her sweat, as she fought against the overwhelming urge. Her voice, strained and filled with desperation, escaped in fragmented whispers.

"Five more minutes... I can't... I can't let go."

The pressure in her bladder reached an unbearable peak, threatening to break through her weakening defenses. Eun-bi's voice quivered with a mix of anguish and determination.

"Please, just a little longer. I can't... I won't give in."

Her body tremors intensified, her muscles screaming in protest. Doubt clouded her mind, making her question her own resilience.

"Can I endure this? Can I withstand the pain?"

Her voice wavered, a plea for strength.

As the seconds ticked away, Eun-bi's world narrowed to the all-consuming struggle within her. The walls of the supply room seemed to close in, amplifying her isolation and the urgency of her plight. With her time running out, she summoned the last reserves of her willpower, clinging to the diminishing hope that she could withstand the unbearable and emerge victorious in this ultimate battle against her body's demands.

After five minutes that felt like an eternity passed, Eun-bi heard someone was coming. Eun-bi's ears perked up at the sound of approaching footsteps, her heart leaping with a flicker of hope. But as the sound drew closer, her voice, filled with both relief and desperation, quivered with uncertainty.

"Is it... Is someone really coming?"

Her trembling hands pressed against her aching abdomen, a mixture of anticipation and fear coursing through her veins.

"Please, let it be someone who can open this door. Please, let it be my salvation."

The footsteps grew louder, echoing through the hallway. Eun-bi's breath caught in her throat as she struggled to maintain her composure, her voice a fragile plea.

"I've held on for so long. I can't let this be in vain. I need to be rescued."

With bated breath, she waited, her body and mind on the precipice of surrender. The hope that had carried her through the torment of the past minutes now mingled with the uncertainty of what lay beyond the locked door. As the sound of the approaching footsteps reached its crescendo, Eun-bi braced herself for the revelation that awaited, praying that her ordeal would finally come to an end.

She heard Dohyun's voice. The door opened with an electronic sound of the card key. Dohyun's face appeared between the gap of the door.

"Eun-bi, are you inside?"

Eun-bi's voice trembled with relief as she responded, tears streaming down her face.

"Yes, Dohyun! I'm here! Thank you for coming!"

Dohyun's expression softened with concern.

"I'm so sorry it took me this long. Are you okay?"

Eun-bi's voice cracked as she choked back a sob.

"I... I made it... just in time."

Dohyun extended his hand towards her, his eyes filled with empathy.

"Let's get you out of there. Go, hurry, Eun-bi."

With Dohyun's help, Eun-bi stood on unsteady legs, finally escaping the confines of the supply room, leaving behind the trials and tribulations that had tested her strength.

She threw her body out of the supply room. But, as soon as she stepped out of the room, she stood froze, and her face burned red.

Her body detrayed her at the last moment, she cannot resist the wave of the urge. She felt the warmness spreads, vulnerably.

"Hssss...splash...spash..."

Eun-bi's face contorted in anguish as the warmth spread, her voice choked with embarrassment.

"No... not now... not like this."

The sound of the liquid hitting the floor echoed through the hallway, an unmistakable reminder of her body's betrayal. Her eyes filled with tears as she whispered to herself,

"I couldn't hold it any longer... I'm so sorry..."

The humiliation overwhelmed her, tears streaming down her face as the scent of urine mingled with the air. The hallway seemed to hush, the silence amplifying her vulnerability and shame. Eun-bi's heart sank as she realized that her struggle, her endurance, had ultimately been in vain.

With her body's needs now forcefully evident, Eun-bi stood frozen, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I... I can't believe this happened... What do I do now?"

She tried to cut in the middle, but she couldn't. Her beige trouser was beyond the limit of absorbing. Small yellow puddle spreads beneath Eun-bi.

"Splatter... splatter..."

The sound of splatters hitting the floor reverberated through the hallway, a cruel symphony of humiliation. Eun-bi's cheeks burned crimson, her voice trembling with shame.

"No... not like this... not in front of everyone..."

The small yellow puddle continued to spread, the evidence of her mortification seeping into the fabric of her trousers. Eun-bi's voice quivered with despair as she whispered to herself,

"I can't believe it... I'm so embarrassed..."

The stifling silence of the hallway amplified the intensity of the moment, the weight of her humiliation pressing down on her. Tears streamed down her face as she stood frozen, her mind racing with thoughts of judgment and ridicule.

In that vulnerable moment, Eun-bi's voice, barely audible, carried a plea for understanding.

"Please, someone... anyone... help me..."

The sound of her own voice seemed swallowed by the walls, leaving her alone with her shame and the daunting task of finding solace in the midst of her public humiliation.

Her release was continued for a minute. Her underwear and trousers were soaked, her shoes were drenched, and the puddle of pee was unable to hide. Eun-bi was embarrassed, but also feel relief as entire pressure had been relieved. Her beige trousers clung to her legs, soaked and heavy, their once neat appearance now a telltale sign of her embarrassment. Her underwear, saturated with urine, provided no respite from the dampness that enveloped her.

Her shoes squelched with each step, the fabric saturated and waterlogged. The unmistakable smell of urine permeated the air, adding another layer of humiliation to her already compromised state. The small yellow puddle beneath her expanded, a vivid reminder of her public display.

Eun-bi's voice quivered as she surveyed her soaked and disheveled appearance, her inner turmoil evident in her whispered words.

"I can't believe this happened... I'm a mess... How can I face anyone after this?"

Mixed with her shame, however, was a fleeting sense of relief. The pressure that had tormented her for so long had been released, offering a semblance of comfort amidst the overwhelming embarrassment. With a heavy sigh, she mustered the strength to address the aftermath of her ordeal, knowing that she would have to find a way to regain her composure and face the world despite the stains and dampness that clung to her.

Eun-bi's voice quivered with a mix of embarrassment and vulnerability as she pleaded with Dohyun.

"Please, don't look... I... I can't bear it."

With both hands shielding her face, she hurriedly made her way to the nearest toilet, her steps heavy with the weight of her humiliation. Her soggy shoes squelched against the tiled floor, leaving damp footprints in her wake.

Entering the sanctuary of the restroom, Eun-bi locked the door behind her, her trembling fingers fumbling with the lock. As she finally faced herself in the mirror, her heart sank. Her once-cute pink oversized sweater clung to her wet skin, the fabric darkened with damp patches. The beige trousers that had been her pride now sagged with the weight of the absorbed urine, their appearance ruined.

With tear-filled eyes, she gazed at her own reflection, her voice a whispered lamentation.

"I can't believe this happens to me... This is my worst day ever. How will I ever recover from this?"

Her face, once flushed with embarrassment, now wore the marks of tears and shame. Her eyes, filled with a mix of sorrow and self-doubt, stared back at her, reflecting the turmoil within. In the solitude of the restroom, Eun-bi grappled with the reality of her situation, knowing that she would have to summon all her strength to face the world once again, despite the disarray that marred her appearance.

Eun-bi's mind raced, panic gripping her as she surveyed the extent of the damage. Her voice, filled with desperation, escaped in fragmented whispers.

"I can't go out like this... What do I do? How can I face anyone?"

Her hands trembled as she tried to wring out her soaked trousers, but the fabric remained heavy and damp. The wetness seeped into her socks, leaving her feet cold and uncomfortable. Eun-bi's voice quivered with self-doubt.

"I can't just walk out there in this state... They'll all see... They'll all know."

Tears welled up in her eyes once more, her voice choked with frustration.

"I've already been humiliated... I can't bear more judgment and ridicule."

The weight of her predicament pressed down on her, the solitude of the restroom offering no solace. Eun-bi felt trapped, torn between the shame of her situation and the impossibility of finding a solution. As she grappled with her own vulnerability, her mind desperately searched for a way to salvage what remained of her self-esteem, knowing that stepping out into the world in her current state would only invite further humiliation.

After few minutes of despair, she heard knocking sound on the bathroom.

"Um... Eun-bi, this is Dohyun. Sorry for what happeded to you, I'll keep it as a secret between two of us." he talked in a tranquil voice.

"I hang a bag of spare clothes on the door knob. I cleaned the aftermath and speaked to Mr. Lee that you are sick so you went to the infirmary."

Eun-bi's heart skipped a beat as Dohyun's words reached her through the bathroom door. Her voice, filled with gratitude and relief, trembled as she responded,

"Dohyun, thank you... Thank you so much."

With cautious hope, she opened the door, her eyes meeting Dohyun's understanding gaze. The bag of spare clothes hung from the doorknob, a lifeline in her moment of despair. Eun-bi's voice, still tinged with vulnerability, expressed her heartfelt appreciation.

"You're truly a lifesaver. I don't know how to repay you."

Dohyun smiled gently, his voice reassuring.

"It's the least I could do, Eun-bi. We all have our moments, and you deserve compassion, not judgment."

As Eun-bi gathered the spare clothes, she felt a renewed sense of hope and gratitude.

"Thank you for cleaning up the aftermath and for covering for me with Mr. Lee. I don't know what I would have done without you."

With a deep breath, Eun-bi prepared herself to change into the spare clothes, ready to face the world once more, this time with a newfound appreciation for the kindness and understanding of others.

In the aftermath of the fateful day, Eun-bi and Dohyun formed an unbreakable bond. They became confidants, sharing their hopes, fears, and dreams. Through their friendship, they found solace in knowing that someone truly understood and accepted them, flaws and all.

Dohyun's unwavering support and kindness helped Eun-bi heal from the emotional scars left by her public embarrassment. Together, they navigated life's challenges, offering each other a shoulder to lean on and a listening ear.

Their friendship blossomed as they laughed, cried, and created cherished memories together. Eun-bi discovered that even in her moments of vulnerability, she was surrounded by genuine care and acceptance. With Dohyun by her side, she learned to embrace her imperfections and find strength in her resilience.

Eun-bi and Dohyun's bond became a testament to the power of friendship, proving that even in the face of adversity, meaningful connections can be forged, providing the foundation for lifelong companionship and support.

As Eun-bi and Dohyun's friendship deepened, a subtle shift occurred within Eun-bi's heart. The affection she felt for Dohyun grew beyond the boundaries of friendship, and a delicate realization blossomed.

In Dohyun's presence, Eun-bi's heart skipped a beat, and her thoughts lingered on him long after they parted ways. She cherished their moments together, treasuring every smile, every shared secret, and every supportive gesture. Her emotions danced between joy and uncertainty, the line between friendship and something more blurring with each passing day.
