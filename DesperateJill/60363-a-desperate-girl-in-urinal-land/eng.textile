"I agree absolutely with you, it is not fair but it is arousing."

That is one of the conflicts of the fetish in that unfairness is sort of at the root of desperation, and it sometimes a conflict to know that other people are aroused by your unfair situation especially when you are almost entirely on the receiving end as I recall numerous times when I was in unfair situations but have seen relatively few other people in situations like that.

"I had some experiences where the boys peed twice or three times and the girls had no chance for a single wee."

I think most guys take it for granted that they will almost always be able to pee as soon as they need to or within a short time afterwards, that's why I call it male urinary privilege, it's something that you are so used to you don't even notice it exists.

It also reminds me of stuff I brought up in my other threads about how it's very common for men to be able to pee multiple times before a woman gets to go even once, such as in situations where there's only a limited amount of time to use the restroom, which means that not all of the women get to go. I brought up numerous times how I once chatting with somebody about how they were on a long bus trip and then thought that the women were basically going crazy stampeding like animals the moment they finally got to their destination, and it was only then that he realized that they hadn't gotten to go at numerous rest stops at which he had, so by the time they were finally at the destination they were practically ready to explode!

Once again I think most guys don't realize that that while they are peeing here and there and all over the place that often times women are not doing likewise and are often holding it a very long time.

"As I have mentioned before on this site, I am very upset with myself and feel guilty for having such an awful fetish. Especially because women often can't pee. I would probably feel a bit better if women could pee anywhere they want, just like guys. I especially love desperation when it is in a controlled environment. Meaning the woman holds her pee because she can, not because she has to. I love when the toilet is two feet away, but the woman makes the conscious choice to hold. That is the difference for me."

Again it's a conflict with the fetish where you are basically taking delight in somebody else suffering discomfort and it's kind of hard to escape from that fact. But from the perspective of a story, whether a real-life story or a fictional one, consciously holding it isn't exactly the same because there isn't that same conflict. If you could always go at the last moment at any time there is nothing at stake and it loses the dramatic impulse for the story. When a person is forced to hold out of circumstance then they have to get creative as a way of dealing with it, and for the person writing the story that is where their own creativity comes in, as it's interesting to find out how she is going to get herself out of the situation.

"Truth be told, I feel guilty just because I have a penis. Obviously, I didn't choose to be born with one, but it is unfair and makes me feel like a rotten person for having an unfair advantage over women. (I know it is strange, but it's how I feel. Sorry, not sorry)."

I don't think that there is any reason anyone should feel guilty for something beyond their control that they had no choice in. I am sure the majority of women if they suddenly transformed into men would probably take advantage of the fact that they could pee more easily simply because why would you make things more difficult as it's not going to help people who are having it more difficult? I mean even though I go on about women not being able to pee as easily as men I don't really blame men for that, again it's not their fault that they can go to the bathroom more easily in the vast majority of situations, and making things more difficult for somebody because they have an advantage when it's not going to help the person with a disadvantage doesn't really help anything really.

"Have you ever tried a female urination device? I wish more women used them. Because A) I am weird, I know, but I am highly aroused by women peeing standing up like men. But B) and more importantly, with these funnels, women can pee on the side of the road, in a bottle, the pee's the limit! Lol But all joking aside, have you ever tried using one, Jill? They might make your life easier."

I have never seen them for sale anywhere except on the Internet and I would feel weird about buying one. Plus now that my job outdoors is over I'm pretty much always at home and really wouldn't have any need for one as I'm pretty much always indoors near a toilet now. And I have heard that even using a device like that you still tend to get pee on yourself.

"Only if you want to, I have a story idea for you. There are a group of two women and two men, just like in your story above. The two guys can pee anywhere and it turns out, one of the women can as well. One of the women has a female urination device like a go girl, she wee, Miss. Piss, etc, etc. She can pee standing up and she is so skillful at it that she can go through her jeans. The second girl (possibly Jill) is envious of her female friend and wishes she could pee standing up as a woman with such an impressive tool."

From a story perspective however the problem is that that gives the women a potential easy out of the situation. I mean I suppose it could be possible that one woman has just one urinary device that she can use on the other woman can't, but from a story perspective it's more interesting when there is no option out of the situation other than to continue holding it. It's the same with diapers, that's not particular my fetish because I'm not into that, but partially the reason is if a person is wearing a diaper then there's no incentive for them to continue holding it, and that basically kills the story since the story is based on the conflict that there is no way to relieve yourself.
