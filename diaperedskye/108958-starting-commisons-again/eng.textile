Hello everyone! Itâ€™s been so long since i last wrote here but i recently got a ton of motivation to write again and i would love to do so for some people! Both wetting and messing stories are welcome. Though i do have some rules!

â€¢ Strictly only female commissions as i do not write male stories, never have and i doubt i ever will.

â€¢ Messing is something iâ€™m not 100% into writing and these kind of stories may take me a little while to write just for the simple fact that i want to capture it perfectly rather than just slapping it onto the fiction section with little thought of how it may be received.

â€¢ I am a human, and i am doing these free of charge, i reserve the right to say no as any artist can and certain stories may come out before others, mainly if iâ€™ve received the commission for them before the other one, or if i simply find it easier to write that one first â€” please respect that boundary, iâ€™m quite a slow writer and while i try my best, that can cause some stories to take days, or even weeks to come out if i have lost motivation for it. This oneâ€™s super important.

â€¢ Finally, please donâ€™t hound me over these pieces of work, as stated above, i am a slow writer and if i donâ€™t get to your story as fast as you would like me to, please donâ€™t hunt me down in dms or something of the like. I only say this because i have had many a bad experience doing this a few times before, and if you do, i will be ignoring you. Itâ€™s not worth the drama, messaging for updates is fine, but when it delves into having a one sided argument with me over a fictional piece of work that i am doing free of charge, itâ€™s just not fair.

Feel free to either do artwork for your commissioned stories, or commission it from others, i love seeing the stuff some of you come up with ðŸ™‚
