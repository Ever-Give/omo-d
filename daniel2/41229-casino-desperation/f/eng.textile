Kate is a blonde woman in her 30's wearing a black blouse and gray pants. She and her husband are in a casino that is currently under renovations. Kate and her husband love to gamble, which is how they first met. They would spend hours on casinos whenever they would get vacation time from their jobs. Several hours in Kate starts to get an uncmfortable feeling in her bladder. Kate is the type of person who doesn't realie she needs to go, until SHE REALLY NEEDS TO GO. Kate knew this as a well known fact, so she told her husband that she has to make a dash to the restroom.

Kate bends down for a bit and then starts running towards the bathroom. On her path she sees a big fountain gushing water out. This makes her bladder kick into overdrive. Kate makes her way to the bathroom, but the stall is occupied. She also starts to hear singing. A big lady in a funny looking poofy hairstyle wearing a fancy black dress is singing. Kate guesses that this place is so fancy that even the bathroom has entertainment.

"Got to let go

And the start the show

Got to let go

Of all I hold"

The words "let go" and "all I hold" start to make Kate feel even worse. She starts crossing her legs and breathing more heavily.

"Got to let go

And feel the flow

Got to let go

Of all I hold"

Kate starts bobbing up and down. The person occuping the stall takes quite a while. She starts leaking a little bit into her panties. Kate knocks on the door. "almost there" responds the lady. Kate hears a flush, which makes her hold her crotch intensily and bend down as her bladder aches. The door open and she runs into the stall. Sweet relief. Kate is letting all her pee out and the flow is nonstop. It feels really good and her bladder deflates a bit too.

Two women are currently waiting as well, Jane and Ellen. Jane is a blonde wearing tight leather pants, and a black jacket. She is short and somewhere in her early 30's. She is grabbing onto her crotch, feeling the tightness of her pants onto her bladder. Ellen is a much taller woman with the same type of hair but she is wearing a small black dress. She has smooth long legs and a nice body. She is crossing her legs every now and then and also fidgeting a little bit.

As for Jane, before Jane got into this mess. Jane is the one who ot hit by the renovations. Jane is the type of person who goes to the bathroom BEFORE things get bad. She likes to be prepared. She is fairly new to gambling so she decided to tag a long with a few friends. After a few drinks she tells her friends that she needs to pee. She rushes to the bathroom only to find it closed due to renovations. She asked a member of staff where the other bathroom is and he points to where it is. Jane makes her way to the other bathroom. This one is open. One stall is out of order but the other stall is free. There is no line. It seems like her luck could turn around. As soon as she enters an older lady pushes her out of the way and closes the door. Through the door she heard -

"I'm sorry I ate some bad seafood and I-"

You could hear the diarrhea from the other side.

"sorry but I do know where the other bathroom is, it's past the big fountain not too far from here"

Jane is fidgeting in her tight leather pants, her bladder begins to fill up even more and she needs to make a dash to the other bathroom if she wants to make it.

She passes the ungodly water fountain and it makes cross her legs and hold her crotch for a few seconds. She makes her way to the bathroom and sees one person waiting, one person using up the stall and a lady singing.

Fast forward to now. Kate relieving herself can be heard from outside the stall, the lady who finished using the stall before kate is washing her hands. Both the flowing water and Kate peeing make this hell for Jane. Jane bites her lip and bends down while holding her crotch. A trickle of pee flows into her panties and she pushes her hand in her crotch even harder to stop it. Meanwhile the singer is still singing:

"Got to let go

Like a waterfall

And forget it all

Of the things I know"

Ellen is not taking any of this "can you sing something else please?!"

The lady still continues to sing

"got to let go

And feel the flow

Got to let go

Of all I hold"

Ellen is crossing and uncrossing her legs. "This is unbelievable"

A spurt comes out from Jane and she is trying so hard to stop the leaks. She hears the flush from Kate's stall which makes Jane leak even more. She runs to the stall the second Kate came out. Now it was Ellen's turn to withstand the pain of hearing Kate wash her hands and Jane relieve herself. It was like a cycle of madness. The flowing water from the sink was causing Ellen to bite her lip and shake her hips up and down.

Ellen is a ruthless manager of the casino that this is happening at and she got her way by working hard and always speaking her mind. Normally this would be seen as a burden in a professional environment but Ellen uses that attitude to expose things or shine the light on truth on things. Her mentality got her up to manager. The fact that this singing lady wasn't paying attention to her was driving her nuts. Ellen drank a lot of water. She kept herself hydrated because she was working extra hard during renovations. She needed to make sure everything was in order. All that water and the fountain near the bathroom made her want to go pee. Her small tight business skirt was making matters worse so she decided to take a quick break to go pee. In the bathroom there was two people waiting and someone in the stall. There was also this weird lady singing. Her voice was pretty good.

Kate left the bathroom but the peeing coming from Jane still is making Ellen profusely sweat. She was shaking her hips and doing a pee dance. She didn't care that the person behind her could see, she was bursting. The lady kept singing.

"got to let go

And feel the flow

Got to let go

Of all I hold

Of all I hold"

Ellen leaked into her panties as she was waiting for Jane to finish. She put her hands up her smooth legs and pressed her fingers into her skirt. Kate flushed the toilet and Ellen began to breathe intensely and bite her lip. She was shaking her legs waiting on the seconds she can finally pee. Suddenly the singer started dancing around the room and held Ellen's hands. She was dancing with Ellen but Ellen couldn't even dance with her. She was in so much pain she couldn't even tell her off like she normally would. The singer twirled Ellen to the back of the bathroom and out the door. As soon as Jane left the stall to go wash her hands, the singer went into the stall to pee. The lady that was previously behind Ellen, who was also bursting was staring blankly at the whole scene. No one knew what the fuck was going on.

The lady who was waiting behind Ellen was a big woman with very light blonde hair. She wore a red dress and was absolutely bursting. She had several drinks with her friends and she has been waiting a for a while. Her name was Beth. She was shaking her hips. Jane was already gone and there was no one washing their hands but hearing the singer pee made beth put both hands in her crotch. The singer was peeing for a solid minute. Outside the bathroom Ellen wa arguing with the lady who was originally last in line. The lady was named Maxine and she was around her mid thirtie, she was a brunette that wore her hair in a big bun. She wore a thin black dress which had those transparent arm things.

"I- was here... first" She leaked a little as she argued. Maxine was a fast talker and she was shaking as she was talking. "I understand what you're going through and I get that you were first but I am really bursting here and from what I know is that you are the manager of the establishment and I'm the customer and the customer is always right" there was no pausing in her sentence, she talked a mile a minute and Ellen was in too much pain to even argue back. The dancer was washing her hands and Beth was peeing. Her flow was like a waterfall. Since she is a rather large lady the pee roared down into the toilet. As Ellen (the manager) and Maxine (the fast talker) were arguing, the lady that was behind beth was crying.

Her name was jenn and she had light brown hair in a small bun. She had a black dress on. She was bursting so much that tears came out of her eyes and she absolutely couldn't take it. The singer stopped as she was watching Jenn finally let out all the pimped up pee she was holding during the whole wait. The pee was flowing straight down her dress and there was huge wet spot in the dress. Jenn ran out of the bathroom still crying. Beth came out of the stall and walked around the puddle to was her hands. Maxine jumped over the puddle and went into the stall. The singer continued singing about letting go and waterfalls. Beth was washing her hands and the flowing water was making Ellen leak even more into her panties. Ellen was in desperate need to let go.

Maxine wanted to mock Ellen due to the argument and began to loudly proclaim her relief. "oh yes! That feels SO good!"

"The flow of my pee is making my bladder feel SO RELAXED" With the flowing water, Maxine's remarks, and the singer singing about letting go, Ellen felt like she was about to burst. Her bladder felt like it was about to pop. She ached to get into the stall. She put her hand up to her panties to prevent the next small spurt or leak. A small leak came through and ran through her fingers. Beth left the restroom and Ellen could hear a bucket sloshing it's way into the bathroom. It was a janitor. Maxine wanted to take her sweet time to make Ellen feel worse. The janitor knocked on the door and said "you better finish up because I need to clean."

"ok then" Maxine flushed and came out. She began to wash her hands. Ellen was trying not to stare at the sink. The janitor was drenching his mop with water to clean the puddle. "Sorry lady but I need to clean, can you step out for a bit? This won't take long.. wait aren't you the manager?"

"I think bossman was calling you, I'm going to take about 5 minutes and bossman says he needs to tell you something quick before his break, by the time were done you can go back, I'll even hold the next line for you"

Ellen gasped for air and responded with a strain in her voice "I appreciate it but I'm ah!" she spurt a little. "I'm about to burst, please PLEASE let me in"

"Sorry manager no can do we got a puddle here and this bathroom is filthy my break is about to start so I gotta clean this ASAP" He begins to clean the puddle and the water sloshing made Ellen tear up. Ellen ran out to not hear that torture anymore. Her boss was standing outside the bathroom. Ellen was pee dancing. She couldn't help it and her boss woud surely understand. "Ellen! I'm so glad you been running things smoothly. You made renovations bearable, and before I go on break make sure that there is no messes on the buffet"

"I appreciate it" responded Ellen in a strained voice. "Are you ok?" her boss was oblivious. "I really need to pee"

"Well I suggest you go know before getting your guys to clean up the buffet."

Ellen would go to the buffet bathrooms but they are all the way on the other side of casino and they are usually packed. Plus, the janitor is holding up any lines just for her. Ellen still had to wait for the janitor was the bathroom was locked. She stood right in front of it so no one can go before her. She knocked the door while crossing her legs with dear life. "I'm almost done"

"Please... jus- let me in" she could barely form a sentence. Another leak came out. This one lasted longer than the others. There was wet spot in her skirt. She was embarassed that customers might see that. Ellen kept crosing her legs and she bent down AND held her crotch. The holy trinity of actions to prevent pee accidents. Sadly Ellen's bladder was giving out. Her pee kept flowing and she couldn't stop. It felt so good. The pee trickled down her legs nonstop. She rolled her eyes up as if she was posessed. The pee felt almost ograsmic. She finally was able to let go after drinking all that water and holding it for so long. Too bad it was in public. A group of people were watching the spectacle some people were taking pictures. Ellen started crying.

The janitor opened the door. "whoops another mess" he laughed. "THIS ISN'T FUNNY" screamed Ellen. The janitor told her to get in the bathroom and lock the door. The singer wasn't there. "Hey" The janitor was speaking through the door. "I know shit sucks but I could use my breaktime to buy you a new skirt from the gift shop, what's your size?" Ellen told him her size all teary eyed. "My panties are also wet"

"Don't worry I got it" The janitor ran off to the gift shop and bought her a jean skirt and some panties with the brand of the casino on it. He went back to the bathroom, opened the door, and told her to change in the stall. She felt like she was in a VIP bathroom, although she was still embarassed about the situation. She changed and went back to work. She got her staff to clean up the buffet efficiently and quickly. The talk about her peeing died down and thankfully she identified the dude that took the picture and told him that if he posted it, the company was allowed to kick him out. He argued about it but the Manager told him off and he decided to give up and continue gambling.

I don't know how to end this story but Ellen just went on in her day I guess lol

The idea was wonderful. The execution was sub par. Kinda all over the place but the thought of those sexy lady's needing to go was wonderful. Maybe spend some more time organizing and proofreading next time? It was hard to keep track of everything going on.

Yea it wasn't my idea originally, the guy that requested it wanted several characters and certain events going on at the same time so I had to back and forth in the story.
