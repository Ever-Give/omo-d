Men can usually pee pretty discreetly but a woman really can't pop a squat without it really obvious what she is doing and expose herself. Women basically have to get half undressed in order to go to the bathroom outside, plus most women don't know how to squat without peeing all over themselves, I know I certainly can't! And I think that most women are taught not to put themselves in a vulnerable situation like that or expose themselves in public like that.

"A man facing a tree is also obviously peeing and everyone can know it but the difference is that men are not ashamed to do a natural thing."

The women are definitely shamed more for doing things that would be deemed natural but I still think that there is a difference because although you can see a man facing a tree and know that he is peeing you usually can't see him actually doing it really. You may know what he is doing but you probably don't explicitly see his genitals. A woman squatting would be very obvious and very exposed in a similar circumstance.

"I often peed in front of my female friends, during concerts, walks, car trips. Some of them peed peacefully, in a minute they solved, others .. they too had to go, but they didn't go because we were in public places and they kept repeating to me "you're lucky you can pee wherever you want". I replied "You can too". I have stories to tell about it, one day I will write them."

Please do! Do any of your female friends get annoyed when you do that, cause I'll tell you it's a super frustrating thing to witness!

"My question is: why do we have to stop the flow?

Why do I have to put my penis in my pants if I'm in a place where there are no people who could be disturbed? (I always hope people aren't perverts or exhibitionists)

Pissing is a natural thing. Even those who watch us do it several times a day.

I'm sorry that it's uncomfortable for women to pee, but I think it's better to show your ass than wet your pants!"

Again I think that the situations are kind of different. Maybe put it to your different way, would you squat outside and expose yourself to take a shit? I mean granted you don't have to do that is much as urinate so most people can wait until they get home for that, but I think that you would probably feel rather exposed if you are squatting and taking a dump in the woods like that.

I mean again is probably a lot of social conditioning and everything but for a woman to be squatting with her ass hanging out is a very vulnerable and exposed position to be in and I think that most people are raised in an environment where that is sort of a big no-no that you never expose yourself like that. I mean I know that I definitely wasn't even though I'm body positive and not prudish I am personally inhibited to a large degree.

Like I said there's often his use of balance, whipping it out and peeing discreetly is not the same as having to squat with your pants down trying to balance and not fall over on your ass. I am just very clumsy and not very coordinated in general so to me trying to squat and pee would just have the same result of me peeing all over myself anyway so if I'm going to pee myself I might as well at least not be exposed in the process!

So yeah once again I think it's a lot different because a guy doesn't really have to expose himself all that much.

"So often women choose not to pee, even though they could. For this reason I don't mind pissing when I get the opportunity, knowing that a desperate woman is watching me and feeling great envy.

I have brave friends who pee everywhere (especially my girlfriend!) and friends who would never do it, even if they have drunk a lot or have an exaggerated need. Pissing in front of them is my greatest enjoyment. How fun is life with a penis :)"

Once again I don't shame guys for peeing outside but really rubbing it in and doing that specifically to torture women is rather sadistic honestly! But again I guess I can't get too angry because in your situation if I had a penis I would probably do likewise and too bad on the women who don't get to pee.

It is still very frustrating though, and I hope that when my job does come back that the toilet situation is better or that I have mostly female coworkers. The first time it was five guys and I, and the second time at least it was three women and three men.

"I've seen pictures of a party on a boat, where guys pee into beer glasses, next to girls looking at their dicks. Sure they were drunk, but the girls had very curious looks. Surely girls had to pee too, but how could they?"

That sounds like a very strange party indeed!

"I feel like the other thing that deters women from peeing outside is wiping. I am nto sure about why women wipe or the necessity but that must be an added deterrance to peeing outside cause it takes extra time and when you are peeing outside you want to be done as fast as possible. Alsom you need to have toilet paper on hand for that and I dobut most women carry toilet paper with them"

Yes not wiping can make peeing outside more a hassle as well though some will carry toilet paper or wipes with them.

"Do you always wipe when you pee like is it actually necessary ?"

I think I speak for most when I say yes.
