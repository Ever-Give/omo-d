Sarah had always loved the sensation of holding her pee for as long as possible, especially when she was out and about in public. She loved the feeling of the pressure building up inside of her, the way her bladder would ache with each step she took, the way her body would tremble with anticipation. But what she loved most of all was the feeling of finally giving in, of letting go and feeling the warm, wet rush of urine flooding her panties and jeans.

One day, Sarah decided to take her love of desperation to the next level. She put on her tightest pair of jeans and a pair of panties that were almost too small for her, making sure that her bladder would be under constant pressure. She then set out for a long walk around the city, letting herself take in the sights and sounds as she slowly leaked into her pants.

At first, Sarah was nervous about being caught, but as she felt more and more of her warm pee spreading through her jeans, she found herself becoming more and more aroused. She began to walk more slowly, letting her hips sway with each step as she took in the sensation of the wet denim clinging to her skin.

As she walked, Sarah felt a growing sense of pride and pleasure in what she was doing. She knew that she was doing something taboo, something that most people would find disgusting or embarrassing, but to her, it was an act of rebellion, a way of reclaiming control over her own body and desires.

Finally, as she reached her destination, Sarah let out one last burst of pee, feeling it trickle down her legs and soak her socks. She then went inside, feeling giddy with excitement as she wondered who else might be able to tell that she had just peed her pants. For Sarah, it was the ultimate rush, the perfect way to indulge her love of desperation and feel like a secret rebel all at the same time.
