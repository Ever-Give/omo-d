What are your favorite things to see in Omorashi fiction?

I don't really like wetting on purpose stories or diaper stories. Or dominant/ submissive sexual stories.

I love stories where it's purely accidental because they were stuck somewhere (in an elevator, traffic, teacher won't let you go, etc.) and a friend or significant other comforts them.

Or better yet, they are sick and too dizzy to get out of bed properly, or something. Or have a high fever and pee during a nightmare.

I guess it's my soft spot for hurt/comfort fics.
