I'm starting up a series of requests for the Undertale au called Omotale. All of you can leave who you would like and a scenario. I'll try to get to all of them if I can and do try to make them a little tricky to do, no simple ideas. It's all up to you guys from here to give me what you got.

Thank you for the challenges. They can be any character that you want to see in any situation since they do have the power of magic. No one said they had to actually have the proper organs for this stuff.

The stories will also be put here once they are finished which might be awhile due to how hectic my life is right now, but I thank you for your patience.
