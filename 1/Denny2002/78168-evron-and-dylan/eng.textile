Chapter One-Keep in mind this was started years ago and i feel some parts are a bit cringy lol

Evron groans as he walks through a human city. He had been sent to earth as a punishment for a failed mission given to him by his king, Lucifer. He remembers just how badly he failed and covers his eyes to fend off an oncoming headache with a sigh. He messed up very badly and feels like a complete idiot.

It is at this moment that a young neko named Dylan notices the incubus. He gets a feeling in his gut that tells him to go over to Evron. Following this instinct, he runs over. Another feeling takes over him and Dylan hugs the larger male the second he notices him. This startled Evron but once he gets over his shock, he wraps his arms around Dylan.

Evron chuckles and speaks in a sultry voice. “Hey there cutie pie~.”

Dylan giggles, starting to fall deeply into little space. Evron notices this and whispers, “Now that's a good little boy, so adorable.”

Dylan whines now, speaking in a higher pitched voice than normal because he started to feel small. “Nuuuu!! Nah coot!!”

“Aww but you are, little one…”

Dylan blushes, buries his face for a second then pulls away, forcing himself to be big now. He is very embarrassed that he slipped. “W-wanna go eat?”

Evron’s heart melts from Dylan’s cuteness and he nods, a soft expression on his handsome face. “Of course, little one, of course.”

They both smile and head to a nearby restaurant. Dylan orders chicken strips and Evron just got a glass of wine. Evron stares at Dylan as he noms on his food.

Dylan blushed under the demon's stare “Wh-what is it?”

“You’re just too perfect to look away from.” Evron replies lovingly.

Dylan blushed deeply and quietly looked down at his food.

Evron chuckles and takes a sip of his wine, smiling to himself then notices that Dylan is squirming.

“Are you alright sweetie?” he asks in a concerned voice.

“Y-yeah…” Dylan responds nervously.

Evron is definitely not convinced but he leaves the subject alone, trusting that Dylan will tell him if something truly is wrong. He notices the smaller boy wriggling in his seat and frowns softly.

Dylan finally speaks up, whispering his need. “P-potty…”

Evron smiles, stands and takes Dylan's hand in his. “Let's go then.”

The smaller boy smiles as he stands, following the larger incubus as he is led to the nearby bathroom. Once inside, he freezes, a look of disgust on his face. The bathroom is horrible. Mold covers the walls and ceiling and the smell is foul, mold mixed with the scent of the puddles of urine on the floor.

Dylan gulps, getting a twisting feeling in the pit of his stomach. He chokes out a single sentence. “I am not using this bathroom…”

“Agreed” Evron says with a curt nod.

The two then leave the horrid bathroom, get a to-go box for Dylan, pack up his food then finally head out of the restaurant then back into town. As they walk around, Dylan becomes more and more desperate. Evron notices as the neko squirms and whines more and though he is worried, Evron becomes aroused. He decides, so long as he is okay with it, that he will push Dylan to his limit.

Dylan whines for a while, his tail soon finding its way between his legs. He realizes something then tugs Evrons sleeve. “I-I forgot to tell you my name…”

“Well, what is it then?”

“It’s Dylan.”

“Nice to meet you Dylan. I go by Evron, sometimes just Ev.”

They then both go silent apart from Dylan's occasional whimper. Evron keeps an eye on Dylan and at one point whispers into his fuzzy ear, “Wanna come to my place? It 's pretty empty since I just moved in but it's clean.” he had indeed just moved in, needing a place to stay while on earth.

Dylan quickly nods, desperately wanting a nice, clean, quiet bathroom. Though, unbeknownst to him, Evron does not plan on letting him use it…

Chapter Two

The pair soon arrives at the apartment building that Ev is staying at. Dylan is squirming and his hands are gripped tightly to the hem of his hoodie. He keeps rubbing his thighs together and hopping from foot to foot as the pair moves to the elevator. Evron notices and chuckles gently as he presses the up button. The elevator dings, the doors open and the pair walks in together. Dylan takes a few shallow breaths, hunched over ever so slightly and whimpering. When the elevator doors close, he whines more audibly and pushes a hand against his groin.

Evron chuckles a little bit and leads Dylan to his apartment. He whispers softly, “Kitten… You look really adorable right now. I want to see how long you can keep this up. Will you hold it for me?”

Dylan blushes at the nickname then his eyes widen from the request Ev makes. He feels shy and nervous but he’s a little excited by this idea. “D-do you have extra pants…just in case?” He asks in an equally quiet tone as the demon unlocks the door to his apartment.

Evron smiles brightly at Dylan’s question and nods. “Yes kitten. I do. Do you think you’ll make a puddle?” He asks in a teasing tone.

The neko stays silent this time. Evron leads him to the bathroom just in case he doesn’t want to engage in the little game before going to sit on the couch. He won’t pressure the boy into something he is uncomfortable with. As he walks away, Dylan looks at the toilet and shudders before going back to the living room and sitting down next to Evron.

“Good kitten.” Evron says to him in a soft but pleased sounding tone. He is very happy that Dylan is willing to play his little game. He had expected him to refuse.

The neko blushes a little bit and looks down at his knees. Keeping his thighs pressed firmly together, he leans against the demon’s side. Ev wraps an arm around him anr rubs his arm gently. “Its alright kitten. You can back out any time you want. I dont want you to be scared. I want you to try and have fun. ‘Kay?”

Dylan takes a slow breath and nods, smiling softly. “Y-yeah… I can do that. Thank you.” He replies before wriggling a little bit and bouncing just slightly on the cushion. The pressure between his hips is getting more intense by the second. Its causing a rather unexpected but not unpleasant throbbing sensation between his legs too.

“Ev…?” He starts nervously. “Is it uh… normal that this is… turning me on?” He finishes in a whisper. He starts rubbing his palms against his thighs now, wanting to keep from holding himself as long as possible.

Evron turns to him and tilts his head. “Hmm? Of course it is. Why else would I be asking you to do this? I’m not an ass. Im just…kinky.” He shrugs as he finishes speaking then leans back against the cushions. “I am an incubus after all.”

Dylan stares at him with a confused expression for a moment before nodding. I have cat ears. I shouldn’t be surprised by that. He things, the same ears he’s thinking about flattening against his head as a wave of need rushes over him. He whimpers softly and grabs his member through his pants, feeling the harsh denim press against his palm as he squeezes his eyes shut. “Nnng….”

After the sound escapes him, he starts breathing heavily. He’s lost in his own world of desperation and near bliss, completely unaware of the demon’s gaze on him. He gasps as he suddenly feels a hand on his shoulder. Evron moves his hand from Dylan’s shoulder and down his arm, soon grasping both of his wrists. Ev looks up into Dylan’s eyes, silently asking for permission which is granted with a soft nod as the neko feels a trembling in his full bladder.

Ev smiles and looks down at the others pants as he pulls their hands away. Dylan instinctively resists for a moment, panting softly. A second after his hands are pulled fully away, a small dark spot starts forming next to the zipper of his jeans. He whimpers softly, still trying to hold it like Evron asked before moaning softly as it all starts rushing out of him. His tired legs twitch a little as they relax and part a few inches.

“Aah…mmm… f-feels good…” Dylan mumbles to himself. After awhile, he finally finishes. He’s left panting in a puddle on the couch with a pleased Evron beside him.

“You did so well kitten.” the demon whispers against his ear, causing the fluffy tip to flick softly. “Youve earned a nice….warm shower.”

Dylan simply nods before saying, “That sounds nice.”
